My wife introduced me to this game and its a game I didn't know I needed. I deal with a lot of anxiety and PTSD from my military service and other stressors in my life, but there's something about harvesting crops and petting your duck named ""Howard"" that just feels so relaxing. This game is an escape from the everyday stress and I can't recommend it enough. And it was developed by a one man army?!

7.66E+16,"I remember buying this game for my brother a few years back. Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for him. I remember seeing him playing it from time to time, the message indicating that he'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that he was enjoying my gift.
Last September he committed suicide.
After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up his computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Stardew Valley.
He had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. He had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of cash. It was only then did I see just how much he loved his present. No other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one. None of his friends really knew about it, however; it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself. Like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (i'll ofetn find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, with the multiplayer beta, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs. Most of all, however, we're all just happy to be together.",TRUE,7028,1034,21,1/26/2019 1:14,steam,3
7.66E+16,"One thing I never realized until I finished the game is that you shouldn't rush it. I got everything done 8 years in game, found all the secrets, got 100% completionist on the tracker, found all the secret cutscenes, collected every hats, accessories, rings and weapons that are available in the game and have completed all endgame content. But when the credit starts rolling, all I feel is emptiness and a void that I can no longer fill up. This is a wonderful game that's just so inviting and calming to play, whether it is by myself or with a friend and now it is all over. 

If you have got the time to spare, take my advice and enjoy the slow ride. Don't rush it and try to get everything with a guide early on, because all there is at the end is the credits.",TRUE,17458,533,8,9/24/2021 12:04,steam,0
7.66E+16,"Stardew Valley feels like coming home.

I can't remember which playthrough I'm on, which is a rarity for me. I've revisited childhood favorites like Zelda and Mario countless times, cherishing each experience. However, as an adult, this happens less frequently. Maybe it's because modern games don't resonate with me as deeply, or maybe my gaming habits have simply changed over time. Yet, whenever I boot up Stardew Valley, it hits all the right notes. Whether I've talked with the residents of Pelican Town dozens of times or played through its events repeatedly, the game retains its magical allure. It feels like a nostalgic return to childhood gaming, a comforting experience I can enjoy every time of the year.

What's truly remarkable is the developer's commitment to continually expanding the game with substantial updates and expansions, all provided for free. Stardew Valley brims with passion and love. Despite its status as one of the most successful indie games of all time, the developer continues to pour his heart into it, enriching the experience for players. I deeply respect and appreciate this dedication, which unfortunately is no longer a given in today's gaming industry.

And after all these years, I've finally reached the summit ?.",TRUE,15331,516,6,4/7/2024 12:41,steam,6

7.66E+16,"[h1]Thank you.[/h1]
I really hope the developers are able to find this review somehow.

[i]We all have difficult times in our lives.[/i]

I started playing Stardew Valley in April 2021, which was not an easy moment in my life. Apart from the COVID pandemic, i was struggling with high anxiety/depression, college was online and the pressure, both from the university and myself, never stopped. It was hard. I cried a lot. But somehow i got through this.
I never played this kind of game before, sort of ""Harvest Moon""-like i guess. But i wanted to try something that i could just... Relax. Enjoy. Take a deep breath and calm my mind. Relieve the tension. Chill.

Stardew Valley, for me, was kind of... a life saver.
I'm still playing it (100h and counting) and the game still do what it did in the beginning: it's an incredibly charming and relaxing game, it's fun and it has likable characters, so far it has been an experience that i am very happy i gave it a shot.
It's one of my favorite indie games ever now. Right beside Bastion, Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight, other favorites of mine.

Stardew Valley calmed me when i needed most. And i will not forget that.
Again: [b] Thank you.[/b]

7.66E+16,"Stardew Valley is a very special game to me. It was one of the first games I ever played on steam. It helped to ground and distract me when I was going through depression and rough patches in my life. I think the charm of the game is its simplicity, beautiful music, relationships with villagers and cute animals. You just seem to slip through time and forget your worries. 

I used to play with a special person who became my best friend and rock, but we have drifted apart and don't talk anymore. Sometimes, when I miss the memories, I visit our old save and reminisce about the past. Please hug, kiss and catch up with loved ones. Make the most out of the present. 

Overall, beautiful game. Please buy it.",TRUE,14687,380,5,3/15/2024 11:06,steam,0

 Whenever I search for a new game I go to the reviews and I make sure that the majority of the reviewers have played for more than 100 hours. Amount of hours played gives a game credibility in my opinion. 

 I have played and played and played Stardew Valley in many ways.

 I have tried all of the maps, explored every inch, and grew to know every character. 

Tonight my hubby and I are delving into the multiplayer beta and I still feel thrilled as if it was my first time playing. 

The music is relaxing, the atmosphere is enjoyable, really everything about this game is made for one such as me.
 I have a four year old and at night after bedtime I hop on my computer to calm down after the day. I nearly always go for Stardew Valley to really destress. (Though recently I have been attached to My Time at Portia lol), but still I come back to Stardew.

Suffice to say, Stardew has become a significant part of my life.
Now 3000+ hours later, I've just started my many-th farm to re-experience the game from the beginning, and strive once more for perfection.
 
Stardew is a game that is simple on the surface, but the world Barone has created is open enough for players to develop their own lore, and has inspired, in me,  fanfiction and mod ideas. The repetition of the early game: the watering, the fishing, even (to a point) the monster slaying, has a meditative calmness to it that allows me to unwind after a day at work. The characters may appear superficially shallow, but once you get to know them you start to realize that they contain hidden nuance and become more than characters on a screen: they become your friends.",TRUE,231860,294,12,8/10/2024 3:47,steam,7

Unlike some other Harvest Moon clones that either forces you to grind hard or have tedious progression, Stardew lets you relax, set your own goals, choose your preferred pace and tell your own story. There is so much to do in the game that can't be written in just words, and it just gets better the more hours you put in it.

7.66E+16,"I grew up playing Harvest Moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories. She would always buy me the new one for Christmas, and we would play it all day, filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry. Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum. 

Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed. It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work.

7.66E+16,"There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said for this amazing game if you enjoyed the classic harvest moon type games you will absolutely 100% enjoy this. The game play seems fresh and fun even after clocking in over 60 hours, You won't want to quit, Just 1 more day then you realize that turned into 5 days and it's 4am and you have to sleep sometime. 

This game, takes the old harvest moon concepts and tosses in a bit of Rune factory and a sprinkle of animal crossing leaving you with a sensational experience. Each day brings something fresh, There is over 25 different Npc's to interact with each day and each one brings their own charm and dialogue options depending on if you take the time to build up your friendships.

Your farm can be whatever you make it, You design what it looks like, how it runs, what you plant and what animals you choose to raise. The fishing can be a bit difficult to begin with but very rewarding and relaxing once you get the hang of it. On days you want something a bit different you can hop into the mine and find some rare gems, ores and minerals, Some that you can donate to the game's huge museum or use to upgrade your tools! 

I can't praise this game enough, if your on the fence about purchasing this game or you think you should wait for a sale, Don't wait! This game was made by a single developer who deserves every single penny for all the obvious hard work and dedication. So go and farm your butt off!!!",TRUE,11102,648,52,3/15/2016 3:21,steam,1
7.66E+16,"""This looks like a fun and relaxing game, guess I'll try it out."" 
Yes, the game is very relaxing and extremely fun, but there is no ""trying"" Stardew Valley. Should you buy this game, then you best believe that you're going to spend at least 40-100+ hours playing it the first time around. It's not a waste of time, not at all. Call it an investment of your time. When it comes to this game, ""like"" is synonymous to ""addicted"". So telling others that you ""like"" the game is the same thing as hiding your addiction (so just accept it for what it is). Stardew Valley is also synonymous to ""productiveness"". No, it's actually the very definition of productivity, since you're going to wish you were as productive in real life as you are in-game.

~~ [u] It starts with making your own character, choosing the farm that you think looks the best or most fun and also picking your companion pet. I'm not going to spoil you on what ""Favorite Thing"" is about. [/u]

During the first few days of Stardew, I pretty much spent my time cleaning up the front yard of the farm. I just couldn't stand the sight of all that clutter and foliage on the ground and repeatedly getting stuck between twigs and rocks was surprisingly infuriating. Lewis, the Mayor of the town, had given me 15 parsnip seeds on my first day to help me with starting my farm. But ""cleaning"" took a lot more energy out of my character than I expected. I found it to be quite enjoyable breaking all of those rocks, cutting down the trees and mowing the grass, since it felt like I was actually cleaning for once. 
     It wasn't until later that I would regret not starting with the farm earlier, since that would have meant getting more income in the earlier stages of the game. That's the thing with these types of games though. You are always going to regret making some of your decisions, whether it's buying the wrong types of crops or planting too many crops and wasting all your energy watering those crops each and every morning. Or you can be like me and do both of those examples at once on top of planting your crops way too late into the season.

Anyways, I obviously got the materials for cleaning the farm, but it's not like I knew what to do with it. I ended up just making a few chests, changed their individual colors and then I began organizing everything that I had gathered. Which was basically just plant fiber, twigs, stones and then the occasional clay that I accidentally got from using the wrong tools on the wrong things. After that, I finally decided I would head into town to try and interact with as many people as possible in one day. I kept getting handwritten mail from characters I had yet to actually meet each and every morning, so naturally I became more and more curious of the town and less interested in cleaning. It took me around 3-4 days before I began to explore, but my farm was basically clear of anything that I might get stuck on further down the line so I didn't really feel like I wasted any time. 
     I began my exploration quest with going into random buildings and interacting with every person I saw. Gus, the owner of ""The Stardrop Saloon"". Alex, his sweet grandmother, Evelyn and his very friendly Grandpa, George that I gave a Dandelion to because I was curious as to what would happen if I gave someone a gift. This is probably the worst gift I've ever seen. Thanks a lot. 
No, thank you George for that lovely comment.

I also talked to Pierre, the owner of the general store and his wife (Caroline) and daughter (Abigail). This was also when I used the starting money to buy more crop seeds, tulips and parsnips because ""why not"" I remember thinking to myself... I then decided to head down south to look for this ""Willy"" guy that said he was waiting near the beach or something. On the way there I noticed a trash can that I for some reason decided to try and interact with. I then learned something very interesting. Interacting with a trash can is the same as ""searching"" the trash can and that naturally grosses people out. This is how I met a girl by the name of Haley. She just kind of stood there staring at me while I was digging through the trash, and I was staring back at her. Since it worked so beautifully before, I decided to give her a gift as well because I didn't know if people would start to hate you for doing, well, what I did. I would like to say that I ""learned from my mistakes"", but that wasn't the case at all, I can't even say that as a joke. Yes, you probably guessed it right, I gave her a Dandelion, thinking that ""She can't possibly hate them as much as George does right?""

Ugh...that's such a stupid gift.

Thinking ""Haley must be related to George"", I reluctantly went down to the beach wondering if I should give Willy, the fisherman guy a Dandelion. As it turns out, I was to be the one on the receiving end. He gave me his rod and man, I never thought that such a simple fishing Minigame could be so fun. I stood there for the rest of the day, wasting away on my character's energy till I had no more. ""You feel sluggish from over-exertion."" It was the first time I was staying up past 12 in-game and my character was walking slower than ever before. I already knew beforehand that your character faints after 2 am, but the only way to make it back to bed in time would be to eat one of the fishes I had caught to regain my stamina. But I wasn't going to break, bend the knee to a fish and eat it raw like Gollum. I was going to sell them all no matter what. So yeah, I just fainted and sold them all the next day at the cost of some extra energy. Probably wasn't worth it, but I did get a few extra pennies that I wasted on buying more seeds. I should've saved up for a better fishing rod...

So anyways, good game.",TRUE,136032,178,34,1/23/2022 19:09,steam,0

7.66E+16,"When I first saw this game I thought it might be kind of similar to the game 'Rune Factory: Frontier' which I had played on the Wii.  I've eagerly awaited a port for PC but as of yet it currently can only be played on PC using an emulator.  Stardew Valley gave off some very similar vibes though so I thought maybe it might be close enough to sort of fill that same gap.

The game starts out simple enough, your grandfather left you a farm and you need to work to repair it and get it up and running again.  You chop logs, break rocks, till soil, plant seeds and harvest your crops.  There's a  lot of room to play around with your farm and where you want to place things.  There's also a foraging aspect which helps encourage exploration of your surroundings too.  The game is more than just a farming sim though, it also has RPG elements and you can battle monsters in the mines that in turn drop loot you can use or sell.  In addition to that it has some adventure game aspects such quests and some fairly light puzzles.  You can date and marry certain people in the town and even have two kids.  Later in the game you can even forge your own weapons and equipment and add specific power-ups to them.

I grew up on pixel graphics so I found the graphics to be somewhat nostalgic feeling.  The animations are fairly simple and the character sprites very 2D but the characters themselves, not so much.  Each character has a bit of a backstory and unique character traits you get to know as you build friendship points.  At certain levels of friendship you're given the treat of special little cut scenes.  You get to make choices on how you respond to the cut-scenes too.  Sometimes it can help your relationship or hurt it.  This adds quite a bit of story elements to the game.

Part of the beauty of this game is that you can play it in so many ways.  If you just want to have a calm farming experience, growing crops, playing around with aesthetics or optimal functionality in your builds, then you can play it that way.  The music in the game somehow manages a great balance of calming and upbeat.  If you want a little more excitement you can delve deep in the different mines and battle a variety of monsters and collecting and crafting better gear.  If you like adventure then you'll probably want to work on completing quests and solving the puzzles.  If you're more into stories you'll probably enjoy making friends with everyone and exploring their personalities.  Really, there's a little something for everyone and enough content that if you get bored there's something else to try.

In the early game it really feels like completing the community tasks mounts to a climax.  It's easy little goals to attain and strive for but once you finish the community center that's really just the beginning of the game.  You can unlock other mines, a desert, and an Island.  The game is much more expansive than you will first anticipate and it's possible that the developer may release future expansions to bring even more content and explorable areas.  The game does have a sort of ""ending"" in which you'll see a special cut scene but you can keep playing on so the game doesn't ever truly end.  You can also create a new character to play again from the beginning.  There are different farm types that present different challenges and benefits which make for a little replay-ability.

In addition to different maps you can also play this game in co-op mode with friends.  I don't personally like multi-player experiences, I prefer solo adventures, but I do like that if you chose to play this way each character can have their own house and while you can work together, you can also go off and do your own thing.  You aren't limited to the host's farm or experiences and guests can upgrade their cabin, get married, and essentially experience everything the games has to offer.

There are really only two things I disliked about this game.  First, there's the save function, you can only save by going to sleep (or ending the day by falling asleep outside your home/bed or ""dying"" in the mines {you can't actually die you just get beat to within inches of your life apparently}).  Sleeping ends the day and your game progress is saved.  However, I often find that I have to leave my game in the middle of a day when I don't have time or the ability to finish my day or even run to my bed so I can save.  Instead, I had to open the menu, which pauses the game, and then either just leave it running in the foreground or if I had to do something on my computer, let it run in the background till I could get back to the game.  So, for example, at the time of writing this review, Steam has 1,062.9 hours logged playing this game.  However, between my two save files I only have about 509 hours logged in-game.  So, it spent about half the time sitting open in the background on my computer simply because I could hit a save button and continue later.

The second thing I didn't like was the fishing mini-game.  I've played plenty of games that have fishing mini-games in them and they are all similar but all have their own unique flair... this one is the worst fishing mini-game I've ever played.  Maybe other people found it easy but I couldn't get how to catch fish.  There's something to do with patterns and clicking at the right times but I completely failed at it every time.  The only thing that made fishing redeemable was actually a mod that let me skip the mini-game portion.  While I don't necessarily advocate mods, I found the game partially unplayable because of this mini-game and it was really ruining my personal experience with playing the game.  The mod made the game playable and fun again.

Mods are actually one of the things that for some players could be a real plus side to the game.  Stardew Valley has a fairly large modding community with mods for everything from changing the NPC's dialogue avatar to skipping fishing mini-games to adding elevators to creating new expanded areas to explore.  If you find yourself too frustrated with an aspect of the game, there's probably a mod for it.  If you love mods for games you'll love this game.

The last thing I'd like to touch on is the game's achievements.  There's 40 of them which is a fair amount and most will unlock naturally over time with normal gameplay, but there are several collection based achievements that you have to work for.  Many of those require a lot of hours of game play.  For example, if you want to catch all the fish you won't be able to do it unless you fish in every season, some require reaching maximum friendships which can take a lot of time to build, and of course others require you to get a huge sum of money.  Collectible items are gained through RNG drops so even if you do everything right you could be doing it a long time to get those drops you need.  For completionists, like me, that can be very frustrating and it's a big part of why I had to put in about 500 hours to get all the achievements.  It could be a lot less or even more depending on your luck with the RNG.

Overall, this game is a gem, I don't usually recommend games at full retail price, but I'd say this one is actually worth it.",TRUE,67709,152,5,5/10/2022 6:16,steam,0

7.66E+16,"By admission of the dev himself, this game is Harvest Moon at its core. A formula that is purely addictive and satisfying as hell. 

But there is something Stardew Valley has over Harvest Moon, and that's a heart. The intro to the game is incredibly human and relatable. I sympathized with my character right off the bat. I think we all know how it feels to want to escape the mundane grind, and in a funny kind of way, this game does that. 

A moment I felt that the game truly had a soul was when I was walking to the mines on a rainy day, when suddenly I was greeted by a cutscene of coming upon Abigail, my romance interest, playing a flute next to the lake. It's a very quiet scene, with nothing but the sound of rain and her flute playing. After some dialog, my character (who is a silent protagonist by the way) pulls out a mini harp and joins Abby in a duet, something that really surprised me as there was no indication that my character had any musical talent prior to this scene. It was a bonding experience, and it felt incredibly real, memorable, and touching. I'll always remember it. 

And when you realize that there are TEN love interests in this game with different scenes like this for each of them, man, that's an intimidating amount of content. 

Maybe I shouldn't be saying that Harvest Moon doesn't have any heart at all, but when it comes down to it, this is the game that I'm going to remember more fondly in the end. I made memories with Harvest Moon as a child. Now I'm making memories with Stardew Valley as an adult. You should too. The game is worth full price and then some.",TRUE,7018,483,29,3/18/2016 9:09,steam,1

9/10 Stardew Valley is a fantastic casual game for anyone that can enjoy a more relaxed pace of things. This game's simple premise of rebuilding the family farm in a particularly quaint village with an array of fun character's to interact with never feels old. Much of the game is spent trying to make your farm plot perfect to your liking while attempting to maintain relationships with the townfolk. Stardew plays at any pace you want to play at and that is especially rewarding, you will find yourself prioritizing and making chore lists and juggling all of your other duties, but you will do so in a natural rhythym of your own pace and comfort. I am highly awaiting the arrival of the multiplayer update as currently I'm playing with my significant other using a mod for multiplayer - while the mod works, the legitimate update will be much more welcomed! I can't recommend this game enough and once multiplayer is released, I dare say this will be a must-own game for gaming couples!

Edit: Multiplayer has been released and is as amazing as we'd all hoped. This game is an absolute must for all gaming couples. While the multiplayer adds additional player cabins to your property that act as your guest(s) home, they can still sleep in the host's bed and use the main house as if it were their own.",TRUE,4511,673,14,1/20/2018 3:12,steam,0

[i]Stardew Valley[/i] is what PC gamers have been looking for to scratch that [i]Harvest Moon/Animal Crossing[/i] itch. If you like that type of gameplay, just buy this. Don't overthink it.

+I mean this was made by one guy?!?
+Beautiful artwork that has attention to details. I mean it even changes dramatically with the seasons. Its incredible.
+Music is absolutely a treat. And once again, changes with the seasons!
+Controller support works ok (I'm just glad it exists).
+Character customization (male/female, sliders for colors, your appearance changes with different gear, etc.).
+You have a large farm to work with. The world in general is a good size. There are 28 NPC's all with their own schedules and agendas. The pixel art for their faces is outstanding.
+You can have a pet, and get married (I haven't even done anything with the latter, yet).
+There is mining and fighting monsters, although the fighting is casual and isn't even completely necessary.
+I could go on and on here really.

-*Sometimes* the controller support part *feels* glitchy until you learn how to use it (mainly the part with the right stick). Nine hours in and I'm still figuring out nuances.
-It would be great if the hotbar were longer so to minimize going into the pause button to juggle things.
-The bin you put stuff in to sell each night should show all of its contents. Why not allow the player to retract items put in right up until they go to bed? Its not a dumpster, so things don't get 'tainted'.

7.66E+16,"""When you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you. - Friedrich Nietzsche 

Some people may have told you that Stardew Valley is a ""chill"" game about farming and making friends. Someone might have told you that this is an easy going, relaxing game that can be enjoyed by anyone, even those who don't normally play video games. Those people were wrong. For me, Stardew Valley is not really a game at all; it is a mirror, reflecting within it the darkness of the human condition, and my own inability to escape it. 

At the time of this review, I have logged 114 hours into this game. I have completed the community center in it's entirety, and I have perfectly optimized my farm for brutal efficiency. I make millions of dollars each season, and, for no good reason, I continue pushing just to see how grotesque and gaudy my industrial hellscape can become. I have never spoken to a single member of the town who cannot benefit me monetarily; if you asked, I would likely only be able to name 5 NPCs at best. I almost never go to the town events and have often found them to simply be obstacles or annoyances in my personal quest for power.  This game may be relaxed for some, but for me, it is war.  There shall be no item left unpurchased, no crop left ungrown, and no slime left unslain. I am become Death, destroyer of worlds.

If you share a desire for ruthless expansion and power, this game is for you. Conversely, if you just want to have a cute little farm and role-play a simple but idyllic rural fantasy, this game is probably also for you.

In short, I really Recommend this game if youre looking for something relaxing. And if you know anyone who is going through hard times, show them this game, it might also help them.

tl;dr - 10/10 , great for anyone feeling depressed",TRUE,3476,355,15,2/15/2017 22:37,steam,0

Okay, tomorrow is Abigail's birthday, I should give her a present and then I'm really going to bed.

Wait a minute, my pumpkins are almost ripe, I should probably wait a couple of days so I can sell them for a nice profit.

Those pumpkins were worth a lot of money! I think it's about time I upgrade my pickaxe and then I can go explore the mines for a bit, just gotta wait a couple of days so I can pick it up from the Blacksmith.

Got the pickaxe, time to go into the mine! Hm, I made it to level 25 today, I bet I can go way deeper if I bring a bunch of food with me tomorrow!

Got to level 60, sweet! Found some gold ore down there as well! Just one more day...

This is what I did for thousands of hours in Stardew Valley:
I worked on this guide since the first release.
I've tested 477 items for 15741 times to 33 villagers,
I've chopped tons of woods,
I've smashed tons of stones,
I've reset the game for hundreds of times,
And I almost lost this guide because my hard disk corrupted.
In case of another disaster,
So I've to release this halfway works,
Whatever I currently have.

I believe Wiki's info are slightly inaccurate. That's why I make my own data references. You can still refer to Wiki if some info is missing in this guide. This guide will be continuously updated when I have free time. I may be busy at life, but I'll try to push updates to this guide. As multiplayer mode rolling up soon, I will include that as well.

[b]Long Review Version[/b]
Once I played Harvest Moon: Back to Nature on PlayStation 1 and Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town in Gameboy Advance. Then I continued to play HM:FOMT in VisualBoy Advance in PC, GBA4iOS for iOS and GameBoid for Android. I went for plantations, mining, fishing, feeding animals, wooing all the cute girls. Unlimited fun hours.

""Dude, which girl are you chasing?""
""Elli.""
""Just pass your game cartridge to me for a day; I'll make her grow to red heart in no time!""
""Then help me to get 999,999,999G for Vacation House!""

We swapped GBA game cartridges, grinding it all the time after school hours. That was my childhood memories.

It all began when a friend of mine told me about Stardew Valley which arrives into Steam Store. A game that packs most of Harvest Moon features, which I played back from ten years time. I went on checking at Steam Store. Apparently, it looks similar as Harvest Moon, but I doubt how fun it is. All the while, the only farming simulator I loved was Harvest Moon. None other than that. Thankfully, my friend borrowed his Steam Library to me. For the first two hours, I was surprised that finally, FINALLY... A real farming simulator on PC platform. We do no longer running on emulators.

So the first month, as usual, I cleared my land, planting Parsnips and then went hunting for extra berries and grasses. But alas, what I noticed inside was totally blew my mind. No grasses but with different loots and proper item names. Dandelion, Daffodil, Spring Onion, Leek, Grapes, Hazelnuts. And then, there's Bus Stop. An overhauled open town that doesn't vertically or horizontally aligned compared to old Harvest Moon. Quests. Fresh storylines. Tons of letters and goodies in my mailbox. Combat mode in Mines. And MINECARTS!

This Stardew Valley is a new fresh farming simulator. At first, I'm at lost, but since I'm an ex-Harvest Moon addict, I still can keep up with the crops. However, challenges turn in which you have to defend your crops from overgrown weeds or crow attacks. Something new, you can feel it. In my first run, I used to be a monopolist. Spent all my money on seeds and gained maximum profits. But then, the funny part I placed almost more than 20 scarecrows to protect my crops.

I've no idea how far a scarecrow range can cover, how to simultaneously plant and harvest crops, how to organise items and much more. In my thoughts, there might be Steam Guide that helps players to play better. It took me few minutes to load a whole guide with heavy images. Images are wonderful, but still a lack of some details. And much to my disappointment, lots of guides in Steam Community are heavily plagiarised with the assistance from Wiki.

Ten years ago, as far as I remembered, game guides for Wiki hardly existed (Or maybe there's one?). Remember how we used CC Cheat Codes, IGN Walkthroughs, GAMEFAQs.com, and many more old sites? Veteran players are very well-versed at this. Most guides are solely written in text format. The tradition of writing text guide is fading. No comprehensive Steam Guide for Stardew Valley community ever had done this.

I stopped my game in the middle of Winter, Year 1. Over the months, I compiled all items and complete gifting. Day by day, data by data is being added to my works. One day, my portable disk went corrupted and thankfully my only backup still resided in my local disk. Thus, I've made my final decision to post my works in GAMEFAQs.com and Steam Community as what you've seen right now.

I as a fan of Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley would like to thank all of the public contributors who had spent years to compile and posted detailed online walkthroughs for everyone to enjoy HM games, and now we're moving on to Stardew Valley. I wanted to do the same extensive guide for Stardew Valley. Also not forget to thank all my close friends who had helped me to test and verify game data too. As I continue to compile the remaining data, your feedbacks are greatly appreciated.

Feels like I'm relieving back some good ol' memories. Soon I'll have my own printed Stardew Valley guidebook on my bookshelf for my collection. Maybe Ill be playing this for another ten years. Thanks, Stardew Valley.",TRUE,212037,533,22,12/6/2016 22:28,steam,0

7.66E+16,"After spending 50+ hours on it, I figured Stardew Valley is due for a review.

Story/Characters: While not heavily driven by the story, Stardew Valley sets up your farm-life, and fills it, with many solid, and fun cutscenes. You'll also run into a few nuggets of lore occasionally. Every villager in Stardew Valley is unique, and worth getting to know.  9/10

Gameplay: The farming life has never been better. I fell in love with farming, then with fishing, then with mining. All these are valid methods of keeping a steady income in Stardew Valley. So, I had fun devoting days to different activities, while also completing different quests and requests from the villagers. Also, there are mods, which I haven't even gotten into yet. 9.5/10

Sound: Relaxing, colorful, and happy music kept me humming while doing my daily work. The sound effects were also bright, and they fit in perfectly 9/10

Replay Value: I played Stardew Valley for 45+ hours. In that time, I completed 1.5 ""years"", got married, earned quite a lot of items and money, and [i]almost[/i] finished the community center. That might satisfy most; I plan to do it all again, with a few mods. 8/10

Overall Score: 8.9

Summary: Personally, I had a ton of fun with Stardew Valley, and will never forget this game. Thanks to ConcernedApe for this awesome game. I love the crap out of it. Everyone should at least try it. Begin your life in Stardew Valley",TRUE,7906,200,12,6/5/2016 3:29,steam,1

7.66E+16,"TL;DR - A fantastic game worthy of whether you buy it on sale or not. I could've paid $60 for it and I still would be happy with my experience. The developer (ConcernedApe) should be proud of the work he's done here, it's a fantastically enjoyable piece of art.

To start, I played this game cooperatively with my girlfriend from the start to the end. [i]As a side-note, if you're going to play with a friend from the start, you want to enable extra cabins. The extra cabins allow 1 extra player to join you. You can start without cabins and build them super cheaply but, if you're wanting to jump right into it, you'll next the extra.[/i]

I'm a very seasoned gamer having played video games since the original NES. It wasn't too terrible for me to the get the hang out it right out of the box [i]I suggest enabling ""always on targeting marker"" in the options as it will greatly help with properly aiming. Also, make sure you're not standing on the tile you wish to interact with, such as tilling land.[/i] My GF is not a seasoned gamer, this was her second game she's played on PC utilizing a mouse and keyboard. I had her enable the aiming marker as well and she had a relatively easy time figuring out what she was doing for the most part.

There is a ton of stuff to do in this game and you can't go wrong with any of them.

[b]Farming[/b] is easily the most profitable and you don't even need to worry about which crops are the best cash crops. It's very appealing to try to have a crop of each type due to the benefit of cooked food, as well as quests that require various crops. If you only grow one crop, you'll missing out on other aspects of the game.

[b]Fishing[/b] is a bit rough and continues to be a bit rough throughout the game. Some of the fish are a pain to catch and remain a pain to catch but, it's because it costs very little to fish and can yield large payouts should you get good at the fishing mini-game. Crabpots are a great way to raise fishing and acquire 'fish' for other endeavors and easy money.

[b]Mining & Combat[/b] these two are together because, they go hand-in-hand. You go to the mines and later elsewhere and in the process of mining for ore you encounter monsters. You don't become an almighty god amongst mortals in this game, you need to rely on placement, timing, and farming/cooking to help you have the easiest experience, especially once you're done with ""the mines"". [i]Armor is your boots and buffs from food. Your weapons are a melee weapon and ranged weapon, I've never used the ranged weapon in combat. Food restores energy and heals you; your crops and livestock can provide better 'food' that is actually cooked that provides buffs.[/i]

[b]Villagers[/b] are an important part of this game and you want to work on becoming friends with them. There's a calender in town square next to a job board, keep track of birthdays, find out what people like, and given them those gifts. Doing so leads to extra content within the game. [u]It's completely worth it.[/u]

[b]Foraging[/b] is actually beneficial and provides a source of income, food, and goods. You use your hoe on 'worm tiles' and you receive items typically for the museum. I suggest doing this as it can give you a leg up on making money and give you access to things that you couldn't get yet.

All-in-all I'd say I love this game. My girlfriend loves this game. It's been an enjoyable experience for a seasoned gamer and someone new to gaming. They did it right with this one and deserve all the praise they get. If you can play with one extra person, farm life will be exceptionally easier. For each extra person, the more specialized you can get. Fishing is always relevant, mining is always as well. Farming is only useful as long as you can grow crops and have money for the seeds (or get a seed maker). With two people we were able to get a large portion of the content done, we're just down to getting the last pieces of 'end game gear' and wrapping up maxxing out friendships.

A few tips if you do decide to get into it.
[list]
[*]Enable always on targeting marker.
[*]Don't stand on the tile you're tilling.
[*]If you have nothing better to do, go mining.
[*]Work on friendships.
[*]Work on the community center.
[*]Grow all the varied crops.
[*]Don't be afraid of the wiki, crops were my usual pages.
[*]Play with a friend if you can. Make a friend to play this with if you don't have one.
[*]All options are valid.
[*]Upgrade the watering can first (gold if you can)
[*]Upgrade the hoe next (gold too but, not as important as watering can)
[*]Don't worry about buying too much equipment for the mines, just bring food for healing/energy.
[*]The upgraded backpack is [b]SO[/b] worth it, especially while mining.
[*]Don't concern yourself too much with min-maxing, it doesn't really matter.
[*]Be patient, take your time.
[*]If you're going to the mines, try to make 5 levels each time you go, the elevator saves progress every 5.
[*]Gather all of your crops no later than the 28th (they all day next season except some.)
[*]All crops die in winter.
[*]Store at least a couple of everyone. I kept the highest tier I could get, sold the rest.
[*]Use winter for mining and reorganizing (most useful for solo or duo play.)
[*]Most of all, have fun and relax. Don't stress too much.
[/list]

",TRUE,36118,155,78,5/12/2017 0:47,steam,0
7.66E+16,"First a couple of admissions. This game gets compared a lot to the Harvest Moon series which I have never personally played. Couple that with the fact that I have also never played a farming sim before and this is pretty much as pure of an opinion on the game itself as you can possibly get.

Now to the point. Stardew Valley is incredibly fun and has managed to hold my interest so much that I'm playing as much as I can lately. There is a bit of a learning curve if you are not familiar with anything from the Harvest Moon series. Friends I know who have played that series and then Stardew Valley clued me into a lot of little things I didn't know about and likely wouldn't have figured out until I read about it somewhere later. But what makes this game even more impressive to me is how a single dev took so much inspiration from something he clearly loved, mixed in loads of player feedback, and built something truely special. I wish I had been one of the people that learned about this game early on so I could have watched it grow (no pun intended).

I also can't help but love the retro art style of classic RPGs, yet with the modern polish and bright colors that make it stand out as still being something new. I can't help but wonder if Chucklefish helped Concerned Ape out with some of that considering how much it reminds me of the art style used in their game Starbound. But either way it's got a surprisingly good level of detail to it with lots of character. As far as how the game plays, I found myself loving the simple yet challenging approach of levelling your five core skills and learning the best techniques to maximize the efficiency and profits of your farm. You start off struggling to make everything work in that first year and by your second you really start to feel like you know what to do now.

The story is also simple but with a lot of charm. Even though Pelican Town is small it always feels like there is something new to discover about the people who live there. While it can take a lot of time and effort to befriend everyone it becomes worth it to see how they all interact together and how much of an impact your character can make in their lives. It's the ultimate expression of a lively small-town community and looking out for your fellow man. Something I think a lot of us lose sight of sometimes in this digital age. But let's not forget the symbol of modern change that takes form in Joja Corporation, a megacorporation looking to monopolize Pelican Town. You can either decide to help them out (for a price) and increase the town's reliance on Joja Corp, or instead work to restore the town's community center and promote local business and interaction, declining Joja further business opportunity in the area. It's a powerful underlying message to the whole game and something many can feel passionate about one way or the other.

Lastly I need to mention the price. For all the hours I've sunk into this game already and will likely continue to add in the future, the $15 price tag feels like a steal. I can't help but highly recommend this game at full price because if you are a fan of this type of sandbox RPG farming sim you will easily justify the cost twice over. I actually bought the game for a friend because it was affordable and something I could recommend to anyone and I knew my friend would enjoy it. While I'm sure it's bound to end up on sale when the initial hype dies down, please don't be someone that waits specifically for that to happen. This game is worth every cent and doesn't cost any more than a month of game time for any MMO out there. If you are sincerely interested and have the money, don't wait.

7.66E+16,"This is by far the best farming game I have ever played. Each season one can plant new crops and harvest them throughout every month (which counts as a season), whilst completing bundles at the local Community Centre in order to claim rewards and selling home-grown produce at shops or the sale bin from the comfort of your own farm. 
One can construct cabins and farm buildings, plant and harvest multiple types of plants, and even plant your own orchards. Mining and foraging, along with crafting and fishing, are also important dynamics of the game and boost your experience level in the game, as well as assisting in the completion of quests. 
One can buy animals as cute and practical additions to your farm. If you're keen on cooking, there is a conglomeration of recipes for you to try from fish tacos to chocolate cake. Your culinary skills will be honed! 
If you are a naturally organised and productive person, there's plenty on offer to suit your game style, boasting daily quests, the opportunity to customise your personal routine, and much more. 
Home-decor enthusiasts may also go crazy with the wallpaper, furniture and decorations if they so desire. 
Of course the game also features a rich storyline, including the ability to interact with local villagers, make friends, and eventually, marry if you wish. 
The freedom to make your own decisions every single day heightens my enjoyment of the game. One of my favourite features of the game are the flowers and scenery and - of course - the animals. My cat Mocha is my favourite and I am eagerly working towards purchasing a horse which will provide speedy transport. :)
There really aren't many negatives to speak of, but if I were to name some, I would think that some of the big ones for me are the following: 
1. How difficult it is to reach level 40 in the mines (and progress from thereon). 
2. How difficult it is to catch fish. 
3. How slowly a person walks. 
I definitely recommend this game to farming enthusiasts and animal lovers alike, as well as anyone who enjoys setting goals and creating routines and just enjoying the game without a ""tycoonist attitude"" which is adjacent to a lot of gamers nowadays. I wouldn't recommend it to those of you out there who love 'reaching the end of the game as quickly as possible', with a cut-the-time-wasters attitude. It is a slow-moving, relaxed sort of game perfect for those who don't take gaming so seriously, but of course it caters for most gamers' tastes. :D",TRUE,6300,98,2,3/8/2021 5:12,steam,5
7.66E+16,"Never have I played a more realistic game in my life. I joined my friends lobby with the sole purpose of doing absolutely no work and being a general nuisance. One day I woke up and got around to getting out of bed at the early hour of 11 AM. I decided to take a romantic stroll through the quaint town nearby. I discovered the town had an old fashioned saloon, being the alcoholic I am irl, I joyfully entered. Unbeknownst to me, money is shared between all players. I spent all of our shared earnings on a single beer. We were now broke.

Much later I learned how to build a relationship with the NPCs of the town. I had my eye set on one frequent saloon goer, all I had to do was gift her everyday? Easy. My entire inventory was filled with fish, an excellent gift for anyone! I gave her one of my most impressive catches of that evening, a gold-starred halibut. Her eyes met with mine and she told me ""What am I supposed to do with this?"" 

Heartbroken and devastated, I returned to the pier where I spent most of my time. That's when I met a boy who lived nearby there, Elliot. I gave Elliot a gift of fish. He greatly appreciated it. I returned there everyday to continue my days of fishing and sharing with my new love. Turns out I was gay all along. Most nights after a hard day of fishing, I spend most nights at the saloon with Elliot, spending all of my friends hard earned cash. Never did I think I could live my love life, be a drag down on someone else's hard work, and be drunken fisherman in a videogame. Stardew Valley has made it all possible for me.

7.66E+16,I don't usually care for games like this but something about Stardew Valley brings me peace and it is now one of my favorite games to play whenever I want to relax and listen to some music. I would really love it if they made it so you could start a server friends can join and work on while your offline but other then that this game is a masterpiece 10/10,TRUE,611,105,2,11/7/2023 1:02,steam,0
7.66E+16,"The chillest game you can play. There's no way to mess up in this game. You see that farm? You don't have to improve it if you don't want to. Maybe all you want is to fish and hang out with Abigail. Or maybe you just want to fight slimes 'till you pass out. Hell, maybe you just want to get drunk and bring the wizard presents. You do you, dog. This game ain't gonna judge. 

There's just so much to do in this game. In the absence of a contemporary Animal Crossing, it's easy to see why it's been such a massive success. What it does is basically take all the heart and spirit of AC and place it within a more relaxed version of Harvest Moon's infrastructure. That's just the basic setup though. The real genius is in the way the gameplay is paced. Taking a cue from Civilization's 'one more turn' mantra, this game is played over a succession of in-game days for which you have a limited amount of stamina to carry out the many different little actions that you can take. These days, essentially bite-sized segments of gameplay, gradually add up to shape a deeply personal experience that feels very unique to the player. That's the killer app here: your farm, your village, your relationships, and your trajectory along the seasons all feel tied up to the decisions you take and the activities you choose to do or not do, day by day. You can breeze through days if you want, just picking up crops and sleeping before noon even hits. Or you can take it slow and optimize each day, cramping in as many activities as you can with your limited stamina. It's all up to you.

This game will also take you by surprise in the ways that it can engage you. Personally, I was worried at first because farm building never really enthused me as a mechanic (in fact, the whole aspect of decorating/improving your house in AC is something I never connected with either). But this game has so much more than just keeping your farm. It's got a good fishing system, which I greatly appreciated. It's got a mine to explore and engage in combat. It has a museum for you to fill in with fossils and other tidbits. It has a house full of mini challenges each with its own reward that will keep you busy for weeks. 

And then there's the dating. My god, this game has some good writing. The denizens of Stardew Valley are a family you'll come to know very well, and each one of them has an interesting line you can follow as you strengthen your friendships with them. As you can imagine, the progression for these relationships is pretty straightforward (you just gift them stuff). But the real meat is in the little scenes that play when you hit the milestones in the relationships. Some of them will stay with me for a long time.

There's just so much value here. It truly feels like an evolution in the genre, with its more palpable and personal progression and the way it doesn't string you around or punish you for any way of using your time. You'll play this game and wish you could have this simple, tranquil life. Considering the game's intro and mission statement, I call that a home run.",TRUE,58739,91,6,9/3/2018 3:59,steam,3
7.66E+16,"[h1] At what point can you write a review for Stardew Valley?  Can you ever finish the game?  Would you ever want to?  For reasons that are hard to explain, this is one of the best games I've ever played.[/h1]

This title is about nothing except escapism.  You will trade your life, ideally on a temporary basis, for the life of your self-designed character in Stardew Valley.  In the game, you escape your boring cubicle job to live a simpler life as a farmer in a close community that is struggling to stay relevant in an increasingly conglomerate-dominated western society.  The game manages to argue an anti-corporate-America ""Wal-Mart is bad, but not inherently evil"" agenda in such a real way that is impossible to ignore; all the while providing you the opportunity to choose for yourself; and unabashedly encouraging you to embrace capitalism to maximize the value of your labor and intellect.  The game succeeds in this alternative reality in much the same way The Sims captured so many gamers' hearts.  In Stardew it seems you are able to achieve things that perhaps you cannot achieve in real life.  However, you will leave the game feeling happy, uplifted, and hopeful.

Beneath this existentialism is a day-to-day deluge of strangely addicting activities.  Mine, farm, make friends, help the community, cook, craft equipment, manage your finances, fish (oh how I love to fish), forage, ranch, etc, etc....  By providing more structure, than say Minecraft's survival mode, the game succeeds in guiding us something much more fulfilling.

The aesthetic, think of it as an improved 16-bit Legend of Zelda, you will soak it in.  It is my phone's background.  You will learn to love the bright colors and simple sprites while despising the grittiness of real life.  The music, it's so simple it should drive you mad, but it's so happy it will soothe your soul.

Reading discussions, you will hear of gamers who are self-treating their anxiety, depression, mental illnesses.  There is something very special about this game.  There is something very important about this game.  It will brighten your days and provide you with a measure of joy.  The saddest part is, I feel like I might be ready to move on.....",TRUE,6351,128,16,5/8/2016 8:10,steam,1
7.66E+16,"Stardew Valley... what can I say that hasn't already been said?  It is a true spiritual successor to a game I never played, called Harvest Moon.  First thing first... if you love Harvest Moon, please go buy this right now and dig in.  If not, hold on and hear me out, then go buy the game...  

The game has you inheriting a farm and building a life for yourself on the farm.  You build relationships and explore in the new community that you are thrown into.  The core of the game is based around a daily cycle, everyday you have to decide what you are going to accomplish each and every day.  This come down to farming, fishing, exploring, mining, and shopping.  But the seasons put pressure on you to handle your farm correctly and time everything down to the day.  It gets to the point you want to just spend one more ""day"" of in game time playing... much like Civilization has the just one more turn phenomenon associated with it.

Overall, there is very little to be upset about in this game.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants a nice and relaxing game. This goes into my gold tier of games, and I can't find any reason not to give Stardew Valley a 5/5... it is honestly worth it just to pay for the game at regular price.",TRUE,5984,204,5,6/13/2017 18:49,steam,0
7.66E+16,"Stardew Valley may look to be a laid-back kinda game, huh? That might be true. But for some people, like myself, this game will suck you into the vortex like a hyper-hydraulic toilet on the turbo rinse cycle option.

Now, I have very little experience in this genre of Harvest Moon lookin' farm games. But it's hard for me to imagine that they get much better than this. There's just so much to do that it's hard to fathom. You've gotta clean up your farm so that you got a nice open spot to plant some little potato seeds. Gotta grow those little stink eggs up right quick to make a nice buck at Pierre's store. But what'cha gonna do while you're waiting for the vegetables? Hmm, I don't know, you could get a fishing pole from Ol' Willy and catch some salty sardines or maybe you wanna go into the mines and search for sparkly rock crystals while you fend for your life in the dank depths of the earth. 

But this is only the beginning of what's on the agenda. You can build some animal coops and milk some cows, build a stable an' ride a horse, befriend the locals and maybe meet a waifu or husbando. You can rebuild the community center, cook up delicious pizzas and give them to your buddies, maybe even sniff around in the open fields looking for grapes and then EAT them. The choices are yours and the pace at which you take it is yours to decide as well.

Great music, great style, lots to do, and a HEAPING helping of getting sucked right into the vortex of no return. This is what Stardew Valley has to offer. Give it a shot if you're in the mood for losing yourself in the endless EXPANSE of farm fresh manure and infinite anchovies.

7.66E+16,"[h1] Overview [/h1] 

Stardew Valley is a game that borrows heavily from similar titles in the Harvest Moon series. You start out in a rural town with nothing but a dilapidated house and crop fields that are more akin to the wilderness than a place to grow vegetables. The game is simple in its understanding: build a farm, make profits, live your life. What the game allows you to do makes it so much more layered. You're left with the freedom to explore the town, its residence, mold your farm into whatever you want it to be and on your own time. Sure, there are events to attend, festivals to see, men/women to romance and marry, kids to have, buildings to construct, fish to catch and weird little slimes to slay (Dragon Warrior, anyone?), but how and when you do those things is up to you. 

In essence, the game offers you very similar things to do as a Harvest Moon game does: Build and upgrade your farm, plant crops, upgrade tools, mine in the never-ending dungeon for precious ore, go fishing, romance and get married...etc. While some of your old favorites are back, new aspects have been introduced as well, but I won't spoil those in this review. Let's just say there's a nice story that evolves over time.

The freedom to do as you please is what makes this game, and Harvest Moon in general, so enjoyable. It's a chance to mellow out, play at your own pace and still enjoy everything the game has to offer. What Stardew Valley does, it does right. It's charming, cute and feels rewarding, even when all you're doing is cuttings weeds. It doesn't pull any punches or try to be something its not; the developer had a goal in mind and Stardew Valley is a reflection of just that. You can feel the effort, the time and the devotion that went into this game over the years. Stardew Valley is a gem and worth looking at. If you loved Harvest Moon, you'll love Stardew Valley.

To date, Stardew Valley is a single player game, though the developer as mentioned some form of co-op or multiplayer availability in the future.


[h1] Pros [/h1] 

[list]
[*] Character Customization - Always good, always wanted. 
[*] Visuals - In the style of the SNES. They're colorful detailed and a delight.
[*] Game Pace - Fast, slow, or somewhere in the middle. It's your call to make.
[*] Content - There is a lot more to do than I first imagined. There are many hidden layers inside the game as you progress the storyline. 
[/list]

[h1] Cons [/h1] 

[list] 
[*] Combat - It's a tad basic since that isn't the core of the gameplay. A single hack/n slash mechanic
[*] Citizens - I'd love to see more citizens (even temporary ones during the year) come and go to make the town feel more ""alive""

Overall, Stardew Valley is a pleasure. I haven't put a ton of time into it (yet), but I easily see that happening. It's fun, lighthearted and addictive. As I said earlier in this review, if you've ever played Harvest Moon, you'll enjoy Stardew Valley. It's worth checking out and I highly recommend it.

- Expandable house, which you can decorate and make extra comfy.
- Different farm types.
- Plenty of various buildings to get onto your farm, as well as really cute farm animals.

I did not eat. I did not drink water. My girlfriend thought I was ghosting her. All I cared about was just one more day, just one more heart on the relationship metre, just one more level of the mine and then I'd be done. But I wasn't done. There was always another day to live, always another heart to earn, always another level to explore. The creators of this game could take over the world if they wanted to; they know exactly how to balance short- and long-term goals to keep you invested in progression while avoiding becoming boring. In short, they know how to grab your attention and they know how to KEEP your attention. But instead, they choose to use their supervillain-level mind control powers to get people to play a cute little game about farming. Amazing.

7.66E+16,"I grew up playing Harvest Moon on the SNES. My parents probably rented the game a dozen+ times before putting up the money to just buy the damn game. My brother and I dumped hours, and hours, and hours into that game. Beating it multiple times to see some of the different endings. 


A few years ago, for the first time, a game was released that bested the original Harvest Moon. That game is obviously Fortnite. JK


Stardew Valley is such a good spiritual successor, that it beats the original hand over fist. It's entirely it's own game, while nodding its head to what I assume is its source inspiration. It exceeded my expectations by a lot, and it continues to be improved on again and again. [B] FOR FREE [/B]


This game has a lot of replayability (just ask my wife who has nearly 1000 hours logged by now). Between different relationships, different focuses, different game altering choices, and different property layouts and designs. There's enough content to keep you entertained and coming back for a very long time. 


It might seem minor, but the games soundtrack is probably one of the best, if not THE best out there. Chrono Cross was my former favorite, but only Stardew Valley has led to me purchasing the soundtrack on digital and two different vinyl releases (okay, one of those was a gift). It keeps the game from getting as monotonous as it MIGHT otherwise get sometimes. Its similar to the Tetris song. After enough playing, the music is ingrained in my soul. Lmao


Gorgeous pixel graphics. Amazing variety and loads of charm. The creator clearly has a deep passion for this game and it shows in nearly every way.


This game deserves so much more money and appreciation than it gets.

7.66E+16,"I bought this game with a certain degree of skepticism. Hearing the hype from my limited circle, althought the hype isn't that high just a tad warm, I approach the game expecting some kind of tame nostalgia over a mediocre genre kitsch.

I couldn't be more wrong.

To begin with, and in all fairness, this game is indeed a genre kitsch. Heavily reminiscing the old days of Harvest Moon yet this game does it extraordinarily well. So well that it exceeds its kitsch-ness aspect delivering a solid and charming experience. This is the case where copying a nostalgic feels didn't resort into nostalgia bait but it, somewhat, surpasses what it copies turning itself into something new. Harvest Moon genre is still a classic for me and Stardew Valley manages to simulate that classics and turn it into something so well.

I bought this game at full price in skepticism. Now after all the tine I spent and taking a break from playing for months I feel like the price does did justice. The overall quality sure doesn't warrant any high budgeted game but its charm are what makes this game worthy of praise. I haven't even mention the fact that ConcernedApe did this on his own.

Gameplay wise, I love the control, the progression, the learning curve and the rewards. It all feels balanced and fair. Though after getting the gist of it the game turns easy it still rewards me, the player, by its sandobx-y elements. When you're rich and capable then you're privileged to challenge yourself, challenge yourself to tidy up your farm. That's what fantastic about the gaming experience. First you begin with nothing, learning all the way to warrant that privilege, and eventually you became master of everything all that's left is to challenge yourself. Through that process of learning you're given a set of goals and charming characters that you're ended cared so much by the time you've became that master.  In my three playthrough I ended up following the same pattern and I'd say that's a rewarding and satisfying experience in itself.

Though to be fair, I'd like to nitpick a bit. And this might be hugely subjective that I found from personal playthrough. Events and dialogue branch. I'm not talking about the Joja/community cebter branch but the character branch. This game offers a great setting to roleplay but the lack of recognition to the PC profile kinda disturbs the immersion of roleplaying for me. To put it frank, playing a gay character and a straight character offers little to no difference in dialogue and that's a bit of nitpicking from my side.

I'm not planning to writw an in-depth review, I'm just rambling over these ideas about Stardew Valley. I've been thinking to write this ever since I got so hooked to the game but always refraining to do so. Now I decided to ramble a bit --to fulfill the community badge goal-- I feel like I've layed off a bit of burden. I might want to revisit this comment some day, just like I want to revisit this game and be charmed again.

Also I'm aware of the impending multiplayer patch. Looking forward to it and hoping that the patch would bring an entirely new experience of playing an already splendid homage of a game.",TRUE,12224,77,2,10/15/2017 7:34,steam,0

7.66E+16,"This game is dangerous. 

When I first started playing I was like, ""It's cool, farming is fun but I don't really see the hype around it."" 

Then I kept playing.

It's gotten so bad that I have 10 tabs open just to look up stuff on the wiki for this game. I open the game and blink and two hours have passed, and while I feel sad that I just lost so much time, I look at the progress I made on my farm and think, ""Worth."" 

This is one of the most fun games I've ever played.

It's designed in such a way that it allows both casual players and competitive / optimization-oriented players to have a blast with this game. There is so much to do in this game, and there's so much to offer. You can spend your days farming, fishing, mining, foraging, talking to the villagers, etc. The game is made in a way in which you don't have to hyper-optimize every little detail like min-maxing profit, time management, etc, because there's no time limit for things (unless you count seasons, but there's always another year) and there's no stakes. But if you want to, you definitely can. 

Talking to the villagers is fun as well, they're well-designed, and you can even find patterns in their daily schedules. There's a lot of details in this game.

I haven't tried the multiplayer, but from what I've seen it can definitely be a lot more fun with friends. But playing solo is extremely fun as well.

My only gripe with the game is that it's a huge time sink. I waited until my semester was over to get into it because I heard about the time sink beforehand, and I was glad I waited, because all I can think about now is, ""What crops am I going to plant next season? Where I should place them? How much money am I making from these? Should I fish or mine? Did I feed my animals today? DID I TALK TO ROBIN TODAY?""

7.66E+16,"Stardew Valley is an incredibly personal game to me on top of being just one of the best, most fun and addicting games I've ever played.

Having played 250+ hours on Steam and probably like 600+ on Switch, I've still not touched a bunch of endgame and/or ""perfection""-related content. Yet, I've enjoyed every minute I played. I love the way you unlock more abilities and crafting recipes for every branch of the game the more you focus on them, I love the fact that everything you can do in the game is a solid way to make a living. Hell, you could probably toss your hoe away and finish a lot of the game without touching the farming aspect, which is crazy for a farming game.

My personal favourite way to make money, especially in the early game, is to just go fishing. The mini game is challenging and rewarding, the more you play it the more things you unlock to add an extra challenge and make more money, get more diverse catches, and so on and so forth. This is amplified tenfold by the new update bringing new events related to fishing in particular, and the mastery system it adds is a great way to incentivize players to revisit previously ""completed"" aspects of the game. 

Bit of a tangent, but the multiplayer is a fantastic addition added in 1.3, being a large timesink for myself. I myself had played the game mainly on Switch when this dropped, having once handed my Switch to my mom and saying ""I think you'd like this game."" I got it back like a week later, she was absolutely hooked and eventually got her own Switch in 2020 to play Animal Crossing and play Stardew Valley together with me, which we spent a good few hundred hours on. She bought the game for me on Steam in 2016 when I was 13, and I bought the game for her on Switch in 2020 when I'd recently turned 17, so it was kind of a personal gift for me to buy her.

7.66E+16,"The incredibly short review is: if you love yourself, you should at least try this game.

Now for the longer one.

I believe when this first came out, I got it as a gift from a friend, and was assured that it was similar ""yet super different"" to a very beloved game of mine: Harvest Moon. Honestly, I didn't touch it for years, viewing most indie games at the time as wastes of money, especially when I was working and in school.

Then, I stopped working, and found myself in an incredibly bad spot mentally. My eating disorder kicked in, I was diagnosed with suicidal depression, with suddenly too much time on my hands and no energy to take up a new hobby. It was my partner who asked if I'd played, he himself picking it up around this time, and it was one soft encouragement of ""you already own it, just try it"" that pushed me to start that first save file. 

Game play wise, it's everything I wish Harvest Moon had been; dynamic movements, a simple UI, clear goals and a sense of progression that doesn't ever feel forced or artificial. Farming is one part of it, so if that's not your jive, there are a magnitude of options to make money and grow what I fondly think of as my other life. You never have to get married, although to have adorably pixelated children a spouse is required, and if you'd like to live the lone wolf lifestyle? It allows it. You never have to make friends, unless you like finishing quests, which some of us don't. 

The combat is smooth and clean, most times. As you level up, weaker things get easier and the challenges posed to you grow ever more difficult. This mechanic means that if you like the combat (not me), it doesn't seem to get boring, even after level 10. Rewards are abundant, treasure and artifacts and minerals that are needed to get some of the better gear in the game - however, there is a luck system, so be warned about trying to hunt for Iridium on a bad luck day. The fortune teller gives you no lies, and it's' not worth it trying to tempt their readings. 

Crops are simple, if not a little tedious in the first year, when you likely have no sprinklers or good fertilizer. Honestly, I'm the type to plan out the farm from day one, but many others throw seeds into large clumps and hey - whatever works for you. Just get used to the sound of running water every time you use the watering can. Many bathroom breaks in the beginning, trust me. Crows won't be an issue after you figure out scarecrows, and as soon as you can craft fertilizer, start basic and put it under everything. I mean it. Crops just die sometimes and when you're like me and want that community center done quickly and efficiently, you'll need every one of them in the first year. Animals are cute, way too cute, and from personal experience in the first year or two they'll make you more money quicker than crops. 

Speaking of the community center, or if you're a opportunistic capitalist who doesn't care about small town businesses, Joja Mart Warehouse: finishing it will bring you joy for about ten minutes, until you realize that it does literally nothing and no one uses it. Waste of so many resources and your actual hard earned gold. 

Fishing is a pain until suddenly you're good at it and your left-click finger is trained on a hair-trigger, crab pots are useless and I hate them, and there's something so satisfying about spending half an in-game day foraging for berries in the Summer that it's hard for me to describe it in words. 

This is a game that is made for downtime, and in my personal belief, does it in a way that's in no way boring or overdone. It's reinvented the ""farming sim"" game to the point where everything else feels lacking. It requires little effort if you don't want to give it, or will lend itself to meticulous planning of crops and other money-making strategies. It's a game that I can sit down with at work for a quick break, or throw myself into for a weekend. Either way, in the words of Marie Kondo, it certainly does spark joy.",TRUE,21738,137,5,3/23/2019 15:24,steam,3
7.66E+16,"I will be the first to admit that when I saw this game floating around steam a week or two before its release I was kind of skeptic about it. The art and pixel style threw me for a loop, and while I loved Harvest Moon style games and Rune Factory 4, I wasn't too sure about spending money on this game. I've been burned before and I was wary of trying it. It was about... I think a day of or after the release and I noticed it had a small sale and I figured, ""Well, I just got paid, and it might be a good distraction until I find another game to play.""

...So, uhm. You might have noticed I have 71 hours of playtime. So I figured I'd better write my thoughts on why I love this game.

Music: 10/10
Everyone knows that what helps make a game great is the music it has. I was immediatly sucked in by the music, it reminded me so much of the Harvest Moon games I played that had such amazing music! If there was a soundtrack available (maybe there is) I would be willing to drop money on it.

Controls: 7/10
The controls of the game are not the worse I've encountered, but I feel it could be improved a bit. Honestly, if I hadn't found the control options this would have had a 5/10 review instead. The 'show tool hit location' was not automatically selected so it led to some frustrating moments just trying to till the ground. The combat was a bit frustrating since you had to turn your character in order to swing the sword in the exact direction it has to go in, but after some practice I've ironed out the kinks.

Storyline: 12/10
Oh my god guys. This, this right here helps make the game for me. Its honestly what I have been sorely missing in other farming games like Harvest Moon. Its not just ""till the land, plant the seeds, make the cash."" No, this is much more then that. I would love to go into detail, but I don't want to give anything away to people who want to come in blind.

Characters: 10/10
 These loveable characters have their own flushed out hopes, fears, and dreams. They have their strengths, their weaknesses, and their own personality. Not one character is the same, their life experiences make them what they are and their background helped shaped them. But at the same time they grow, they adapt, they change. The more you interact with them the more impact you have on their lives. Its amazing.

Character Customization: 10/10
What many Harvest Moon games lacked until recently was being able to customize your farmer. However Stardew has by far the best I have seen. Around 30 different hair styles, over 100 different shirts to chose from, skin color, eye color and hair color. You want to make yourself look like the hulk? Get your green on and hulk up for some farming! Want to be a vampire? A demon? You can be anything!

I would add more but honestly I am a little under the weather as I'm writing this and I'm rapidly running out of energy. So a last few tid-bits for you guys and gals considering this game.

This game does not end in an XX amount of years. You can keep playing for as long as you want.

It doesn't matter what gender you are, you can romance ANY of the 10 available. Are you a gal that likes other gals? Yep, you can woo, date, and marry them! Are you a dude that wants to smooch, woo, and marry other dudes? You can do that too! Guess what else you can do? If you're unable to have kids the traditional way you can ADOPT! You can have a family! Or if you don't want a kid you don't have to have one (at least, I'm pretty sure you don't have to).

All in all, 9/10 game that I plan on playing for a very long time!",TRUE,50838,129,14,3/7/2016 11:50,steam,1
7.66E+16,"I didnt want to write a review but Stardew is a game that deserves one... I bought it to strengthen my friendship with a friend who had played it for over +500 hours. Every day after school, we would play Stardew together. While i only took care of the chickens, they managed the entire farm... Even though I lost the friendship that grew because of Stardew, i still miss my chickens... I hope they are taking good care of my chickens. Play Stardew on your own, at least you won't get hurt and you'll have a happy farm to enjoy...",TRUE,10895,145,20,8/20/2024 14:26,steam,7
7.66E+16,"In this game, you can:

-Make friends
-Go exploring
-Relax and potter about your farm all day if you feel so inclined
-Date and marry a qt redhead, who will always be faithful to you
-Make silly amounts of money

If you're like me and can't do any of these irl, then I heartily recommend Stardew Valley.

7.66E+16,"Stardew Valley created by one developer by the name of ConcernedApe, is a game similar to Harvestmoon/animal crossing  etc finally with a similar gameplay created for the pc but is bigger and better. It isn't about the 3D graphics that makes this game genre great but rather the gameplay and the amount of content this game comes with. This game is a piece of gem among indie games and I rarely say this when it comes to indies since there is so many. Might not be your cup of tea if you do not enjoy that type of series but then again that is unless you also own a console. If you never tried this series before take a look below or try it. Will be creating a great guide for new players to be the best farmers and to understand the mechanic. Will also update the review as new contents/ multiplayer releases.

[h1] Video Review [/h1]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGjsM6nJYg

[h1] Pros [/h1]
+ The game offers resolutions, bindable keys for keyboard, controller support (Xbox controllers),  and even Rumble support, insane!
+ 4 seasons of gameplay and years with weather system and natural disaster surprises
+ Game mechanic is great, 1 min for an hour ingame, energy bar to control what you can do in a day, and a punishment system of losing gold if you tire out, fail to sleep at 2 am, or even lose all your health.  With so much things to do you feel like you never have enough time as an illusion even though you really are playing quite a bit from 6 am to 1 am.
+ Great music, sound effects, and good looking 2d art which are funny and cute.
+ Multiple dialog answers to certain people at certain times.
[h1]?THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CONTENTS SUCH AS?[/h1]
?Exploration
-Explore desert, sewers, and a mine which acts as a sort of dungeon with over 80+ floors! while upgrading weapons and a bit of armor killing monsters. Tons of secrets to find and explore
 
?Making Money
+being able to do farming assortments of vegetables during certain seasons and being able to grow trees, take out sap etc so much more
+Growing a livestocks and being able to benefit from them, LIVESTOCK EMPIRE with chickens and cows
+Forage items in the forest from woods, stones and plantlife. Just randomly picking up random things
+ Mining and adventuring to make money is addictive.
+ Fishing is included which is tough a bit but gets better as you progress
-+Crafting mechanic in game to craft aesthetics, useful house addons, or even machines and devices that makes life easier which are witty and then being able to place them.
+ You can cook and be Gordon Ramsay by learning recipes from TV or level it through discovery.
+ So much questing, helping townspeople and taking request quests from the boards which helps earn some pocketchange and also increase relationship with the people around you besides giving them gifts.
+ Encounter events that comes with cutscenes with the ability to skip them too if you seen them which is a nice feature for multiple replays.
+ Being a friend to the local museum and donating to them to great rewards you can also do rewards wait until the community town hall opens for even more rewards!

?Use of money!? -
+ Expand your house, have people check your crib when you get your kitchen etc lol.
+ Upgrading your gears to go in the mines. Shoes, Rings and even Weapons such as daggers, swords, clubs and slingshot.
+ Upgrading your farm to add various buildings and special buildings for livestocks etc.
+ Interacting with community and gifting them to progress.
+ Taking part in minigame festivals that are seasonal and plenty.
+ Getting married to the bachelors available, whichever sex you want and whoever is available with thier own unique content, choice is yours.

There are a ton more stuff but I won't spoil them and my words are limited, so limited that I cannot even LIST IT ALL FOR YOU, There are tons of items and special secrets to discover, Plenty. There is always more each time you accomplish something, something else opens up.
Multiplayer comes later because this was released to let the people enjoy the SINGLE PLAYER. Possible content later on? Hopefully!

[h1] Cons [/h1]
- The fighting mechanic could definitely be improved on, standing around spamming clicks to swipe enemies can get tedious at times.
- More emphasis on the pet system, you can only choose dog or cat but after that you don't really do anything with them except ignore them running around the farm. Give them water sometimes but no food.
- Bugs in the game that can cause entire restarts to your game because of no manual save since the game is newly released.( The dev is fixing it up as they pop up and already has dedicated time into this be warned ahead of time!)
- Lack of tutorial for new players ( game expected that players recognize the rules from games such as Harvest moon, rune factory, animal crossing etc. (I am working on a super guide for you guys on this)
- The GUI (interface) could be much better with drag and drop features so you have to click and being careful on not reselling items you bought by mistakes or even pressing escape because you click too fast, I have resold my 50 seed bags by mistakes DOH! or rebought the same gears.
- Alot of systems can be a bit more in depth later on to add challenge, such as vegetables rotting etc. Would be nice! (not really a con but nice idea to add more challenge)


[h1]?Conclusion?[/h1]
These are just some of the things listed in the content becuase that was what important while playing the game, The sheer amount of content created by one person was mind boggling. This game is really special and sometimes it might be or might be your cup of tea but if you take your time and dive into one of the listed content above and really try it out you might be too late for that refund.
15 bucks for hundreds of hours here and also multiplayer coming later on. You tell me if thats worth the value. I've spent over 50+ hours so far",TRUE,3576,371,11,2/27/2016 10:11,steam,1
7.66E+16,"Most of the hours I have in this game have been spent playing with my girlfriend. Its some of the best bonding time we have, we legit spent at least 3 hours straight designing the interior of our home and we still giggle when we get into the same bed together. Shes a completionist and has totally showed me aspects of the game I never knew existed cause I will literally just farm the entire time I play. I love this game, the multiplayer was a huge boost to it and Im so glad to have a game I can play with my girl. Shes very picky about games she plays, luckily we are both huge fans of Harvest Moon. So naturally I had to tell her about this game and its just awesome. If you got a significant other and you like to get seriously grossly cute with eachother and enjoy games like Harvest Moon, play Stardew Valley together. You wont regret it.

EDIT: Hadn't touched this game in quite some time. Then my girlfriend comes at me all excited cause there was a huge update. So we played again, had more fun arranging our new home on that new island. Not finished yet though. But yay for more bonding time. Again, if you and your significant other like Harvest Moon type games, get this game and play together.",TRUE,7033,114,17,1/5/2019 6:43,steam,3

it's such a chill game. yeah, it can be pretty grindy, especially very grindy if you wish to go for full achievement/game completion. but you don't have to focus purely on the grind - you can also talk to the villagers if that's more your type of thing. you can choose to focus on decorating your farm instead of grinding too for example, or collecting animals :D

most awesome of it all, this game has been made by just 1 person! definitely worth giving it a try!",TRUE,15917,50,0,9/6/2024 23:08,steam,7
7.66E+16,"?? A relaxing farming game that lets you play the game how you like without being too punishing. (Farming, fishing, mining, collecting..) 
Has high replayability and has many mods to improve the QoL of the game. Just ONE! dev made this game, and put a lot of love into it. Stardew now even has multiplayer.
Overall: 9/10

?? Pros:
+ Calming farming game that isn't too punishing.
+ Has many secrets, still learning new things about the game 230h+ into the game.
+ Easy to pick up, hard to put down.
+ Has many mods to improve the QoL in game and visual gameplay.
+ Nice soundtracks. (Eg I love the ice mining level and fall music.)
+ Good price for the amount of time played in this game. I even bought Stardew for two friends at full price, when I usually wait for sales to buy my games. 

?? Neutral:
: ConcernedApe is the only developer of this game.
: Addictive. Play when you have a lot of time to spare.
: Best played going in blind, then learning as you go along . 

?? Cons:
- Some useful tips (such as clicking longer on the upgraded watering can to water more tiles) are not stated in game. You have to discover it for yourself.
- Game starts out slow for the first 4-7 days. (Picks up later.)
- May not be for people who dislike calming games / are purely into FPS games.
- Several bugs in multiplayer mode. (Luckily relatively minor)

7.66E+16,"i was not interested in Stardew Valley at first because farming doesn't seem to be my thing. i bought the game for the new multi-player feature to play it with a couple of friends.

i tried it in single-player mode just to learn the basics, and for the next two weeks, playing this game was basically what i did besides sleeping. this is the first game i have ever spent more than 100 hours on. i didn't know if i spent so much time in Stardew Valley because it was the perfect escape from real life or because i fell in love with the game... but now i know it's both.

i wish i knew that farming is just one of the many things you can do in Stardew Valley. there are so many details and secrets in one small town to be discovered... and you have all the time you need to discover all of them. you can forage and dig up things everywhere, you can socialize with townsfolks - each with unique personalities, likes and dislikes - and fall in love with them, you can mine the heck out of the local mines, and then mine the heck out of a limit-less mine elsewhere. you can play the game however you want, and Pelican Town still stays beautiful and vibrant regardless.

I was convinced to ""try out"" the game before I judged it, and with my lunatic of a mind--I bought the game to try it out. The reviews don't do it any wrong. I absolutely love the game, the concept of the game is that you ""escape"" the modern lifestyle of working to live in the countryside where your grandfather once owned a farm pass down to you. I can tell you, I honestly feel warped into the game myself, as if Stardew Valley is where I go when I want to ""escape"" the world around me. 

The game allows you to marry NPCs, own pets, do quests, farm, sleep, mine in caves, kill monsters--basically everything you could think of in the average life style plus a little sprinkle of monsters here and there. I don't think I have ever felt this close to a game since forever.

You are not just working. In this Valley there are several people you would probably care about, and some you can even marry. I remember putting a stupid smile just because I made a NPC happy. The soundtrack is amazing as well. Puts you on the mood real quick.

While playing this game you can relax and just do what you want, or pay attention to time and events. It is all up to you. It offers much freedom like choosing farm or your lifestyle.

7.66E+16,"A wonderfully crafted game with a lot of heart and addictive gameplay.

In Stardew Valley you'll start with creating your own character, choosing from different hairstyles, clothes and select if you're more of a dog or cat-person.
After that, you'll escape your dull city-life and move to the farm you inherited from your grandpa.
Doesn't look like much in the beginning, but that will change over time.

You'll probably start off clearing out the space around your farm, chopping wood, cutting grass and mine some stone, then putting some seeds into the ground, watering them and wait for the harvest.
To skip that time, you can head to the nearby village and get to know all the different characters in town, give them presents to increase their friendship and find out more about them through small cutscenes which appear after you reached a certain friendship level.
There are also a handful of single ladies and men which you can marry later on and get children with.

If you are not so keen on farming, you can also build barns and coops and buy animals. They will produce goods as well (eggs, wool, milk etc).
Fishing is also an option, which requires to solve a little mini-game. 
Or you could head into the nearby mine to get some coal, gold/iron/bronze-ore and other things. But beware! The mine houses some monsters like bats, slimes, skeletons and more which will attack you if you're close enough, so don't forget to pack a sword and some food to replenish your health.

Everything you harvest and mine can normally also be used for artisan goods, which will require different equipment you need to craft first, but in exchange will give you goods that can be sold for a higher profit (or used to craft other things like food).

There is plenty to do in Stardew Valley, to explore, to craft, people to talk to and a lot to enjoy.
Of course, at some point, tasks can get repetitive and even tedious, but you also have a lot of goals to strife towards from upgrading your house, getting friendship up with all the people, catching all the legendary fish or furnishing your house.

It's a beautiful game in which you can sink a lot of hours into.

7.66E+16,"Stardew Valley is a wonderful game filled with character, heart, and there is also farming and mining. There is so much to do in Stardew Valley, and I appreciate that you can do it all at your own pace. The game can feel a bit daunting at first and you will find yourself playing on one screen and having the wiki open on the other screen. There is so much packed into this game. Theres farming, selling, mining, fighting, crafting, cooking, and building. All of which are done very well aside from the clunky fighting.

Where this game truly shines is in the people that populate the game and the story that unfolds as you get to know each person. Is Shane the town drunk, or just a young man fighting depression and hopelessness? Is Haley a stuck-up princess or will she realize there is a good life in the simple and mundane? Will Leah do something with her art? Will Clint overcome his low self-esteem and ask the girl he pines after out? Is Penny destined to live a hard life with Pam, her alcoholic mother? Why is George such a grump? He will tell you and you will look at him differently afterwards. Will the two secret lovers ever become public? Will Lewis put himself first instead of the town? Will Elliot get the courage to write? Will the governor ever like the town soup? Will Marnie ever be available when you want to buy animals? Nope!

Each character in the game has personality and a story to tell. As through these stories your first impressions of characters may not be the impressions you have of them later in the game. Shanes struggles hit home for me as did Pennys longing for a different life.

This game helped me get through some dark times in my life and I am grateful I purchased this during the Steam Summer Sale. I am even more thankful that I took the time to play the game and understand it. Putting in a little effort makes the journey a far more enjoyable experience.

Lastly, the modding community for this game has turned the game into an even better version. There are many mods to choose from and I appreciate all the creators for the work they have put into this wonderful game.

I wish I was being dramatic, but I'm not. Stardew was literally my escape from the world, work and stress, and I would spend hours upon hours just living life at the farm.

I hold a special place in my heart for Stardew and I wholeheartedly cannot recommend this game enough. It has everything to offer;
*RPG Elements of multiple choice and romance options.
*Dungeon delving into the mines, defeating monsters and finding new items.
*A farming simulator of knowing how to manage and regulate your fields for the best value of crop worth or just for fun because growing flowers are pretty.
*Or just genuinely giving you a break from the world.

It's soothing, calm, and you have all the time in the world on the game to live your life however you want. There is no pressure involved at all, but you're never short of anything to do. Even if it's just showing your in game cat or dog some love.",TRUE,18383,207,4,1/1/2017 2:32,steam,0

I'm generally afraid of games with grinding potential, but questlines starting from daily errand from bulletin boards and ending on Ginger Island offer some ending points, arbeit 100% perfection is quite a long task to not skip with using some external help. I didn't mod, but thinking back going for SMAPI at least for not switching to wiki as often and animation cancelling shortcut would make progression so much more manageable.

It's great how this game manages having potential both for casual and for min-maxing, and personally for me I would love to play it casually, but I can't chill untill chests are sorted.

7.66E+16,"Stardew Valley is an uniquely entertaining game. Even though it appeals more to casual gamers, this game has a lot to offer.  Whether you are interested in combat, farming, fishing, socializing, etc., Stardew Valley has is the thing.

I must begin by saying that the art style of the game is just purely beautiful. I can't think of something that would fit better for a game like Stardew Valley. It's really neat, seeing games that aren't afraid to take a more minimalistic approach and succeed. The soundtrack is also a key element in the experience, and it delivers. Not only does it perfectly fit the game's atmosphere, but it is also one of those soundtracks you'll dearly listen to even outside of the game.

The premise of the game is simple. Life in the city finally overwhelms you. You decide to open the last gift your grandfather gave you before he died. He left you his farm in Stardew Valley, and so your journey begins. You are greeted by an abandoned plot of land which you must restore to its former glory and by the nice little community of Pelican Town, a small town near your farm. So you start discovering the joy of a simple life there, day by day, as you slowly but steadily  gain the trust of the citizens, turn a profit from the crops you grow back at your farm and join the Adventurer's Guild to fight the threats in a nearby mine. Saying more would spoil the beauty of discovering that little community on your own.

The gameplay is straightforward: you take care of your plot of land to grow crops and that's about it. No end goal. No limits. No hand-holding. You are left to discover the beautiful life in Pelican Town bit by bit, since you can do pretty much everything you'd want to. The controls and mechanics are simple, but sometimes less is more.

The one thing that I really liked about the game was the passage of time. You get to enjoy all of the seasons, each of them coming with its perks and disadvantages. You get to grow different crops based on the season you currently play through and the npc's also react differently. There's holidays to be celebrated, friendships to be discovered and romance to be had! 

If you think you can enjoy a relaxing, slow-paced game like Stardew Valley, then go ahead and buy it, do yourself a favour. Altough the game might not be for everyone, it is certainly worth a try. But be careful, It may become quite addicting :)

TL;DR: A nice little game about life in a small town, with plenty of combat, farming, socializing and much more. Build your farm from scratch and start making profit, try to solve the mystery behind Pelican Town or even get married. Truly the best experience for when you just want to unwind from a long day and play a nice little peaceful game.

7.66E+16,"A deceiving game, Stardew Valley is the story of a young man/woman that has moved to a small coastal town with a vibrant community and ecosystem in an attempt to escape from the crushing burden of corporate work and take on a respectable career in farming. 


All of this sounds great, so why is it ""deceiving?""


After you've played the game for a while, you start to notice something: there's only a few areas you can go to. There's your farm, the town, the woods, the beach, the mountains, and if you have the bus stop running again, you can go to the desert. However, this ""city"" that's mentioned so many times, and is even shown once, is completely inaccessable, as is the rest of the outside world.

At first, you will just ignore this fact. It's not significant yet, and there's plenty of exploration to be done.


However, as you continue playing and get past a couple of years, something else starts to become apparent.

Nobody changes at all. Not a single person will age; the children that are present stay children forever, the old man in the wheelchair never dies, and nobody grows up. The only exceptions to this rule are your children; however, once at a certain point they will stop aging forever. No amount of years ever changes any of this; you could go to 1000 years and nothing will have changed.

You will also notice that there is no way to die. You can eat poisonous mushrooms, but all they'll do is make you pass out from exhaustion. You can have your health lowered to 0 by taking too much damage from hostile creatures, but you'll just end up in the hospital and lose some stuff from it. You cannot die by starvation, freezing, drowning, dehydration, burning, and you can never get sick with anything.

You are immortal, immune to death or aging, as is everyone else in the game. You will forever be condemned to life, eventually rendering any and all activities boring beyond comprehension, and there will never be an end to this boredom. By moving into the town, the worst curse to ever be conceived has been forced upon you, as with its other residents. 

While your grandfather's death suggests that escape is the only way to be freed of this suffering, this task is impossible for you. The only place the bus can take you is to the desert and back to town. You cannot escape by following the road, as an invisible forcefield blocks the way. There is no path to the outside, and you cannot teleport out by magic.

The true antagonist of Stardew Valley is your grandfather. He is the one who tricked you to move to his farm. He forced you into this life, while ensuring his own immunity. He is the true mastermind of this world. The only purpose you serve and will ever serve is being a source of entertainment for him; you are the embodiment of an act of infinite foolishness, and are thus a matter of infinite comedic value. 

There is no freeing yourself from this torture. You are left to the agony that is life for as long as time exists, unable to express your pain. Meanwhile, your grandfather, the sole survivor of this hell, forever laughs at you from the afterlife.






It was all a trap, and you fell for it.

7.66E+16,"Do you remember harvesting carrots in 1997? The glow of SNES Harvest Moon on a Yamaha tube television warmed your face as you toiled under a friendly Spring sun. Behind you in the kitchen, your parents exchanged urgent whispers -- you couldn't catch much, but it was hard to miss ""When do we tell him?"" and ""It's treatable,"" amidst your mother's tears.

You got a Gameboy that Christmas, which proved a welcome companion to every roadtrip in your family's faded red minivan. Harvest Moon GBC allowed you to keep harvesting carrots and picking flowers throughout 1998, the hum of wind against the passenger side window accompanying the game's serene soundtrack as you were driven around town to various doctor's offices and radiation treatments (which your mom promised wouldn't turn her into a lizard-person, even though you thought that would be okay. Lizards were strong, and their tails grew back -- what was wrong with that?) 

In 1999 you got a Nintendo 64. You tried hard to smile when you opened it, even though you didn't feel that happy. Your mom wore wigs now, and even though you still thought she was beautiful she always disagreed when you or your dad told her so. Somehow, petting a cow and harvesting more carrots made you feel a little bit better about it all.

In 2003, you graduated high school. Your mom was too sick to attend the ceremony, but you knew she was proud of you. You unwrapped your graduation gift on the foot of her hospital bed, inside lay a used Gameboy Advance and Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town. You spend the rest of the night crying under your bedside lamp and planting carrots. College and all the changes it brings is only one season away -- but at this point, you figure more change can't possibly be bad.

Working your way through college, you graduate in 2008 -- a semester late, and a delay which you chalk up to life's constant ability to surprise us. Who could've guessed that your hand-me-down minivan would need a new transmission and new brakes just two weeks apart? Despite all the challenges, you graduate with honors. After the procession, you find your father waiting for you in the parking lot. He gives you a big hug and makes a joke about how today is the last day anyone in your family can wear a dress in public. Even though it's a graduation gown, not a dress, you humor him with a chuckle. 

Once you get home, Dad slips you a small box adorned with red string tied clumsily in a bow. ""It's not much, but it's all--"" you cut him off, assuring him it's perfect. You don't even have a Nintendo DS, but you find one listed cheaply on Craigslist and agree to meet the seller in the parking lot of the local Dairy Queen. You bring the gifted copy of Harvest Moon DS: Island of Happiness along with you, so you can make sure the console works fine -- which it does.

Three hours later, you realize you're still in the parking lot of Dairy Queen -- choking back tears as you struggle against the game's poor implementation of the stylus and sluggish movement speed. Maybe you were wrong, maybe more change meant things getting worse and not better. You shove the DS into the glove compartment where it rattles for the entire drive home.

Over the next 8 years, life continues to surprise you. You meet a girl in the lobby of your office building. You offer to share your homecooked lunch with her the next day if she shares her homemade apple pie today. She reluctantly agrees. Two years go by, you give her plenty of flowers and take her on plenty of dates. You ask her to marry you. Again, she reluctantly agrees.

You find a new place and move in together. Your old red minivan dies and you buy a new car together (well, the car was used -- but it was still new to you.) You get a promotion. She quits her job. You start a garden in your backyard to spend more time together on weekends. She buys twelve types of herbs for her side. You plant carrots. Lots of carrots.


Before you know it, it's 2016. Your daughter just celebrated her third birthday. She finally fits into the blue dress Grandpa gave her for Christmas -- you send him a picture of her wearing it with a message that reads ""Looks like I won't be the only one wearing dresses in the family anymore."" He responds, ""What?"" -- but you call him to remind him of your conversation back after your college graduation and he laughs. You swap fond memories of mom til your wife appears in the doorway to ask you for help tucking Lucy into bed. After reading a bedtime story, you decide to hop on Steam and play something before you hit the hay yourself.

Stardew Valley pops up on the front page. You buy it on a whim and start a new game. The screen fades in on a sickly family member lying in bed, handing you one final gift before they depart. That gift is a deed to an old farm and a new life. You take a survey of the land and begin farming, exploring caves, and harvesting carrots. It's as if Harvest Moon has changed again, only this time for the better. As you toil under the Spring sun once again, you finally feel at home.",TRUE,15385,77,8,2/28/2016 8:08,steam,1

7.66E+16,"Stardew Valley is a towering achievement not in so much that it's a really fun game (spoiler: it is), but that it was made by just one person. And not only it that it was made by one person, but that every single aspect of the game was so expertly crafted.

The game looks and sounds beautiful, and from what I understand Eric Barone crafted both the art and the music himself. By itself, that's impressive. Then you consider that he programmed the entire game, balanced everything, wrote the characters and dialogue, and filled out this world head-to-toe with fun, satisfying, and interesting activities. If you have any interest in games as a medium beyond just playing and enjoying them, Barone's story is mindboggling. 

There are numerous small examples of Barone's craft that make themselves known beyond what normal games of this type display. For example, the way people will allow you to pass them with a small shake if you press into them enough, or the sound effects that play when navigating the menus. These might seem trivial, but they're indicative of the quality of experience here. There is so much polish and character to every aspect of this game, and all of it adds up to make Stardew Valley a masterful experience.

Another example of this depth of quality are the character interactions. I'm a sucker for good character writing. In Stardew, each character that populates the town is expertly written, with deep character backstories that surprised me. Even the characters I initially disliked proved to have more going on underneath the surface. I went into Stardew expecting a pretty straightforward indie farm management experience and I got so much more.

Each pursuit is gratifying as well. I initially hated fishing, but soon grew to enjoy it once I gained basic acumen. Mine-diving and battling monsters provided a satisfying progression as well. And, of course, farming and building your home and land up from being overgrown to being a palace is not only incredibly satisfying but works exceptionally for what you'd expect. I put down Fallout 4 because its settlement system was so awful, Stardew Valley's--although it admittedly has much less going on--Is an absolute dream by comparison. And tying this altogether is the Community Center system, which requires you to plug in specific types of ""loot"" for various rewards. It's what finally got me addicted to Stardew, staying up way too late trying to catch that elusive catfish, or reading the wiki while at work so I could find out how to get specific Artisan goods.

If what you've seen of Stardew Valley has interested you in even the least, you should probably just give it a shot. I thought I knew what it was, but it proved far deeper and more polished than I ever expected a game made by one person could be. And if you liked its spiritual ancestor Harvest Moon, then you owe it to yourself to play this game. It's a phenomenal example of the power of a singular vision when creating art, and another example of the flourishing indie scene that's developed in gaming over the past decade or so.",TRUE,13460,82,2,11/19/2018 13:01,steam,3
7.66E+16,"A small dip into this game makes you aware that this is more than what it says on the tin.

Almost every aspect of this game seems to have been given serious and careful thought. 
Down from the sounds of the environment to the visuals and character stories (yes they exist here).
Very well rounded crafting, farming and selling system revolving around the seasons and player levels.

You gain a significant sense of community if you choose to interact with the villagers and help them out.
With all those positive said lets look at what could possibly be improved.

These mostly refer to end-game as this game's pace is judged by how you play and therefore you don't miss out on events as they will pop-up when you start working towards them.

Map size? Possible the bus service takes you to more than just Calico Desert.
Farm size? Possibly allowing the player to expand the farm as things can get cluttered.
The RNG achievements. These should not be as grindy as they are, for people who want to have a perfect farm/collection/friendship points, should be allowed to without having to fish for days on end or hoe-ing at the artifact worms like a madman until all sanity is lost. And Praire King should just be left alone and treated as a separate game altogether. 

Otherwise there is not much else that can be improved upon. There are bottle necks with resources if playing with friends, but i find these are necessary as you should have to work hard to get a big, profitable farm going.

7.66E+16,"10000000000/10 Get it bought and play it!

It took me so long to play this game, so many people recommended it and I kept putting it off and off. Mostly because of graphics among other things. I played all Harvest Moon/SOS games and those type of games in recent years were getting really stale with the same tired formula. But eventually I got Stardew Valley on Switch so I could play it on the go like a DS- and my god- I wish I'd of picked it up back then!

I've sunk hours and hours into this game but one of the best pluses is that I connected with my friends/family playing it co-op. I love the gameplay, it's suited to any playstyle- you wanna just play a dating sim, it's that, farm sim? Go raise some livestock or grow crops and trees. Just like designing stuff? You've got numerous Farm layouts to choose from and go ham. Maybe you like combat- or just plodding about adventuring. There's always something new in this game and was addicted well and truly. And I am in the minority that absolutely love the fishing game!

Then, I bought it on steam and was introduced the modded community and fell in love with the game again. It opens up the game completely and there are so many mods that turn the game into something completely new. Or if you're like me and loved the core game, just adding stuff into it that's just for aesthetics or adds new places/people. Similar to how you would add DLC to a game. My favourites and 100% must haves are ""Stardew Valley Expanded"" ""Ridgeside Village"" Hell there's even magic now so you can be your own wizard!!  

What I will say is that SMAPI- the modding device is pretty complicated to put in, but the mods themselves are really simple once you get past initial setup! 

I do appreciate that I played it vanilla first and I would recommend anyone do that FIRST because like a good book/movie you can't experience twice, this you actually can and it's worth it.

7.66E+16,"[h1][u][b]Introduction[/b][/u][/h1]

At first glance it might look like a simple 2D clone of Harvest Moon, but the game gives more than what meets the eye. As someone who has been immersed with the gameplay for almost a week now, the only thing that I could say is to bid farewell to your personal life and have fun.


[h1][u][b]Gameplay[/b][/u][/h1]

The game starts off with you talking to your grandfather and him handing over a letter that will give you the chance to change your lifestyle in the future if you ever so desire.
Years later on, you are living in the city and working as an employee of a grand corporation named ""Joja Corporation"", but feeling empty inside. That was then when you remembered what your grandfather left you and took the chance to start a new life with nature.

[b]Welcome to Stardew Valley![/b]

In this game, you play as a village farmer who inherited the land from your grandfather. After the introduction, you will also start with the basic version of tools that you need for growing and maintaining your farm (which can be upgraded with the required items and money through the town's blacksmith) and some cash to purchase the things you need (which is basically money to buy seeds).

Each season will cycle on a 28-day basis, which also has you limited on the crops that you can sow and harvest (aside when growing them inside the greenhouse). Weather also changes depending on the prediction from the forecast which will help you on planning the tasks you need to do as the game progresses.

Aside from the farm, you can also interact with the other villagers (NPCs) by either helping them out from a certain request or by giving them gifts, which will help you in befriending them or even be intimate (only for those who have the [single] word below their icon on your list) if your relationship level is high enough. 

But not only that! You can also fish, mine ores, find and donate artifacts, raise farm animals, turn your crops or goods into products, forage fruits and flowers, or even explore dangerous caverns and mines and become a true adventurer!  


[h1][u][b]The Pros[/b][/u][/h1]

[list]
[*][b]Tons of Content[/b] - There are tons of things to work on this game aside from farming. May it be socializing with other people, fishing, excavating and exploring the mines, etc. This attribute pretty much sums up most of the great things this game as to offer, which also contributes to the second factor.


[*][b]Immersive Gameplay[/b] - I am not really certain which feature is the most prominent factor that makes this game addicting, but I am confident to declare that each and every single one of them works in harmony to bring out the best for its players.


[*][b]Great Audio[/b] - The soundtracks made for this game really fits the theme of each and every scenario it has to offer. Not only the soundtracks but also the ambience effects really make up the feel as a whole. The sound of the animals, the rustling of the plants, and flow of the water are just some to enumerate.
[/list]


[h1][u][b]The Cons[/b][/u][/h1]

[list]

[*][b]Minor Bugs and Game Errors[/b] - Though it might not be game-breaking, the game still has a fair amount of bugs and errors that could be a point to improve on. Some of the bugs that I have encountered are showcased on my screenshots so feel free to check it when you have the time. 

[*][b]Too Immersive Gameplay[/b] - You might think that this portion is a joke, but I am dead serious about this. For someone who works on a daily basis, I really don't have the leisure of playing games like before when I was still studying. I already spent my leaves for this month and cancelled a few meetings with friends and colleagues, and I am expecting worse to come. This game WILL take your TIME and if you don't have the WILL to sacrifice it, then at least stay away until you have some kind of long vacation.

[*][b]Repetitiveness[/b] - This is most likely the nemesis of every simulation game. After every year, there will be small additions to the cycle of the game to make it fresh as long as possible, but it is still inevitable that you will reach a stage where you can say that you have played enough.

[/list]


[h1][u][b]Final Thoughts[/b][/u][/h1]

Well, I'll just save you the time and get straight to the point. If you ever had that one bit of interest when you saw this game, [b]DO NOT HESITATE AND GET IT[/b].

Lot of fighting over who gets to use the carpenter, running over to one of your friend's lands to chop down their trees (PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRECIOUS FRUIT TREES and the ones like free estate that you can cut for you wood supply) for more wood, spending your time watering someone else's crops cause you got nothing much to do (UNTIL THE SPRINKLERS COME INTO PLAY AND EVERYTHING FROM THEN ON IS STONKS, BABY, AH YEAH), getting competitive over in-game events and games (INVOLVES cursing and laughter), experiencing events together (like dancing with your friends CAUSE FRIENDS GOT THE YOUR LONELY ASS BACK), and, well, watching your farm grow from scratch--- JUST. WHOLESOME. STUFF.

7.66E+16,"Stardew Valley is an indie attempt at a Harvest Moon title, and a very good one. The game gives you a big assortment of animals, crops and fruit trees, which you'll need to tend to and sell, or use them to create artisan goods. Eventually, you'll have access to tools that automate your daily watering, feeding, shearing, milking, and egg collecting, which enables more time to focus on the social aspects of the game, or fishing, or exploring the mines.
Each character can be given up to two gifts per week, which increases your friendship level, granted they like the item you hand to them. As your friendship grows, you may be treated to a cutscene when you run into that character next. Friends will also give you useful gifts and recipes in the mail so try to remember what everyone likes and keep them on hand.
The mine is a great resource for stone, geodes for the museum, and valuable minerals. It's full of monsters and you can easily get in over your head if you aren't careful or come unprepared. If you pass out in the mines, the valuables you just found are liable to be stolen, or you may be subject to a rescue fee.
My advice is to not focus too heavily on farming or making money. Diversify your days and work towards completing the achievements in the menu. Also, don't neglect the community center; gather or plant everything you need for the current season. There's nothing worse than having to wait a whole year to complete the community center because you forgot to plant it before the season changed. And don't feel disheartened if grandpa gives you a bad review. Keep playing past the two year deadline and stop when you feel accomplished.

Take a moment to realize this game has been made by a single multi talented guy. I tried to help dev-ing some video game with some friends and that shit is really hard. Combinning code, gameplay imagination, balance, art, music. I was thinking, okay if he really did it all by himself ... im sure he was slacky on music, or sometimes art. Nope and Nope. 
The most amazing thing in the game if we take everything in consideration is the music. You can percieve some Mr Uematsu vibe sometimes it's really soozing, nostalgic and very well made. 

Mr Concerned Ape, if you read me : thank you for this beautiful, nice and complete game. You did even more than great, and im not a farming game fan. Thank you for including a complete donjon/fight system in that kind of game. Thank you for taking time to work on music and sounds. And please if there is some strength remaining in you, keep adding content ! pleaaaaase ! (Or make another game because you are born for that) some ideas : New areas, new characters, new monsters, new junimo's stories, new crafts, new items. May be adding dunjon bosses ? More complexity on foods effects ? More weapon types (bow, throwing knives, gun ?), armor slot ? head with bonus ? may be even some spells ? i think you can make that rpg part grow even more ! : D

7.66E+16,"[b]Stardew Valley is one of the best games I've played in a long long long time.[/b]

When you follow a game's development for three years it's kind of hard not to have high hopes and in the past I've bought 'Harvest Moon' style games only to be let down but honestly, Stardew Valley is everything I've been looking for. 
I have played Harvest Moon religiously since I started gaming but there was never anything even close to it on PC so the second this was released I purchased it. Boy, am I glad I did. The first time I played it was for around 10 hours straight and I only stopped to sleep. 
If you're a Harvest Moon/Rune Factory fan then I can't see you not liking the game as it has everything those games had and more. 28 main town NPC's for all your relationship building needs, a HUGE farm (I'm not kidding, it's massive) for all your crops (and there are loads), as many coops and barns as you want for your fuzzy little animals and so. much. crafting. Also, mining, fishing, festivals, random events, casual monster combat, minigames and so much more. [b]Also, Multiplayer is coming!!![/b] I'm 50 hours in an I'm showing no signs of stopping. 

The fact that this was made by one person should also be noted. There was no Early Access bullcrap. No endless Alpha/Beta, just the game which I'm glad of. Any bugs that have been found have been quickly patched and the dev is STILL part of the community and still listens to the ideas of his fans.  
I personally can't find many reasons to fault the game. There have been bugs but so far I only encountered one and didn't lose more than ten minutes play in reloading which wasn't much hassle to me but I can see how it could annoy some people. 
 
[b]So if you like this genre, just go for it. Stardew Valley is ConcernedApe's love-letter to Harvest Moon, and it's one worth reading.[/b]",TRUE,14433,187,9,3/3/2016 1:13,steam,1

7.66E+16,"Stardew valley is a great game. 

Don't be put off by the retro graphics or lack of guns and shiny fast paced action. If you want those then chances are, you may miss the point of the game. 
The game for me was almost a little like inception.... as one of the reasons I game is to escape. To get away from the stress and pressures of everyday life, work and other. In Stardew Valley, you do just that! 

The opening cut scene reveals a character who is unhappy with a dead end job and seemingly no prospects. Until they find a letter from their late grandfather - bequeathing them a farm in Stardew Valley, something he himself went and escaped to in his lifetime. And you go, and you farm, you learn what works, what doesn't, you meet people, you make friends, and if you work hard at it, maybe more. You go fight monsters, you learn to fish, you help people, but you are never bored (except maaaaaaaybe in winter) as there are *always* things to be done on a farm. And there's plenty to explore as well. 

The thing I like about the game are the layers in here. As you become invested in your character you learn about the villagers you've moved near to; they each have their own backstories., which you find out both directly and indirectly. They each have things they love, things they hate, people they like too. It's a reminder what life *could* (and in the past in some places, was) be like. 

And it has a *lot* of replayability value - yes you'll go back in understanding the farming and some of the mechanics, but that gives you freedom to make different choices, and concentrate on other things.... so move on up and settle yourself in to Stardew Valley and regain some lost sanity and some hope.",TRUE,15683,185,5,6/23/2018 7:58,steam,0

I usually hate all these pixelated retro style games, Ive played them when I was a kid and I always dreamed about better graphics, so thats pretty much the reason. But this one is an exception, I fell in love with it from the very beginning. Relaxing gameplay, relaxing music, you can do whatever you like and theres so many things to do.

Gameplay is where the fun is. There are many activities in the game. You can saw the field with vegetables, berries, flowers or whatever, water it every day and wait until it grows. Then harvest them and choose what to do, you can simply sell everything or make pickled vegetables, use it in one of your recipes to make some tasty food and maybe even share it with others.
You can have animals and take of them by feeding them. Like cattle or chickens and make mayonnaise from the eggs.
Got bored from growing plants or collecting eggs? Go cut the trees and collect wood to build a fence so that your chickens wouldnt run around your farm or upgrade your house or go fishing and hope for the treasure. Theres also cooking and recipe collecting. You can cook dishes from the resources you grow or collect then consume or sell them. Other activity is getting social with locals, doing requests for them and improving you friendship, maybe even marrying one of them in the end and have a nice family. Dont forget to decorate your house, you dont want to bring a girl to your shack like some dirty peasant after all.
Another activity is fighting monsters in the dungeons and collecting ores and crystals. It will take a while to finish the dungeons but it's a good change from all the farming.

Time never stops here except for holiday events where you have special tasks. So you need to plan your daily activities. You cant go everywhere and do everything. You either go all social or go to a dungeon or take care of your plants and animals, theres not enough time for everything, if you push yourself too hard you pass out.

Graphics. Well I still prefer modern graphics but modern graphics doesnt always look better, it can be ugly as fuck. This pixel style looks decent enough and I dont think the developer couldve made such game with cool modern graphics with a small budget, so I always say if you dont have a budget for good looking modern graphics, go artistic style then. Still i prefer My Time at Portia looks.

The game has quite a big modding community so there are some good mods. Check out nexus for the mods.

I recommend this game for everyone, I think most people should like it more or less.

7.66E+16,"I totally recommend this game.

Before the promised 1.11 update, I played for almost 90 hours with little break.
My job allows me to do so, haha.

This last version helps with a ""issue"" (personally, I don't care too much about this aspect, thus I wouldn't call this a issue) with the replayability.
After the 80th hour, I felt that there was little to nothing to really do in the game anymore. I reached a point were the only thing at my horizon was to make my farm HUGE in profit, maybe f*ck my marriage by getting way too well with the others in town and finish some unfinished quests.

This is were the lack of replayability would bleed a little the potential of the game.
There was no way to move your buildings once built in your farm. You would have to, in order to reorganize your farm - for aesthetics or to time optimization -, move everything (animals included, maybe sell them) to demolish the building in question, so you could rebuild it with your new and improved farming techniques.
After the 3rd year, though, you would have to use your golden guts to do so - I hadn't courage, haha. It was going to be too complicated.
By this time, some players would probably create a new save and start over. I tried, but missed my old farm before my 1st hour in the new save, with a new character, was completed.
I decided to wait for the 1.1 update - it was on its way - with the sensation, though, that the game had already lived up for it's price, for the concept and idea of the game was beautifully thought and executed.

If the 1.1 update's fate were to never see the light of the day, I would already be satisfied. Maybe even dreaming with a Stardew Valley 2.

But it came!

I got back to the game and I'm happy to tell that this free update does much more for the game, the replayability, for the characters of the town and for your farm than most of the paid DLCs of most games nowadays does.
This update actually makes the game looks way too much cheap, haha.

You can now reorganize easily your farm, do some new quests, expand the farm in new ways with new buildings and interact with some characters that previously to this update wasn't possible.
Now, also, the game has different farm maps that totally represents the different ways to play and profit in Stardew Valley. This feature totally valorizes the replayability of the game, since selecting different farm maps in different saves will surely change completely how you play your farm.

At least:
I would recommend this game even before the update. I played for almost 90 hours and was completely satisfied.
But with the 1.1, this game is a must-have - specially if you miss good Harvest Moon games and have a crush on RPG.

Do not fear: your money will be valorized with this game.
(And I don't even talked about the incoming co-op mode! Haha)

---------Expanding a little about the incoming co-op mode

@Lappro, this is the result of your request (:

I was just thinking that it might be a good idea to wait for more information to come out before it, since I don't know exactly how it will work out. So this part of the review is more of a reflection of what the future could bring, haha.

There is already a way to play it co-op using MODs, but I haven't tried it yet. Saw some gameplays with it and, for me, the bugs would much rather damage my hype than satisfy it.

Making a long story short: The distributor Chuckle Fish is working on translation as well as the co-op mode, while the creator (Concerned Ape) is fully focused in creative content. He, alone, worked on this 1.11 update.

Maybe, taking in consideration the work so far invested, is safe to say that with the co-op mode will come as well some new content to deepen the multiplayer experience.
I say this because, while I would love to play with my bride, I can see the game becoming too easy as well - since the simple possibility to share the tasks would nearly double your energy bar (meaning that you would do twice in a day what you normally would be able to). This taking in consideration only a 2 players co-op. If it allow more to join... Well, the logic is simple do apply here.

All this, though, would not, in any way, ruin the experience.
Exploring the dungeons (to gather resources or fight some creatures to complete some quests) or expanding your farm with more people will surely be entertaining.

With the 1.11 update came somethings that can be used to create some hostility in your farm. A map and a ""spell"". I haven't tried it yet, but it makes enemy creatures come to your farm at night. I'll certainly try these new features with my bride (:

I will expand my review with these information and more once the devs give us some new updates towards the incoming mode (:

7.66E+16,"What is Stardew Valley?

Stardew Valley is, simply said, my GOTY 2016! Since this review will contain minor spoilers, stop reading now, just buy the game, even at the full price, and spend the next dozens of hours in Stardew Valley!

This review is based on an incomplete experience, I did not even get to the first winter yet. I have only 30 hours in the game, as I write this, and that is nothing. Still, after almost three months after the release, it is time to make this review. And yet, this is not an ordinary review, it is more like a love letter.

Stardew Valley is a farm simulator. Calling it a Harvest Moon clone, however, would be like calling Quake a Wolfenstein 3D clone. The game takes elements from Rune Factory, Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, mixes them all together, and presents us with a small world to explore that holds its mysteries.

The story is simple at first: You work for Joja, a huge company, and get tired of your life there. So you move to a farm that once belonged to your grandfather. You arrive there with a character you created yourself - boy or girl - and start your new life. You meet the townspeople, start seeding and watering your first crops, and soon notice that Joja also has a business in town. Your first real conflict comes from the Community Center. Will you help rebuilding it to its former glory, or will you assist Joja in expanding their company? After a few days, you discover that an old mine has opened, and you can start mining ores to improve your farm tools. Eventually you can build more farm buildings and work with animals or even slimes. You can fish, you can forage, and you meet more people, unlock a few more places to visit eventually. You can even fight and sell monster remains, or use them to craft things.

Gameplay:
Well, the gameplay follows very much the Rune Factory formula. The controls are fine, but you should enable the option that makes you see what field your tools will work on. Like in Rune Factory etc. you run around and can converse or use tools with a simple click. As said above, there are many things to do - would you rather grow crops, forage shells, fish or mine? Or all together? In each profession you level up and unlock new blueprints that you can craft, including better sprinklers, so you will want to specialize in everything sooner or later. But the progress often comes naturally, just as you play. And then you have the mysteries to unravel: What are the mysterious creatures in the community center? What does the wizard know? Where are the mayor's pants? Umm, okay, I solved the latter one, but let us just not talk about it. Anyway, the quests, awkwars as they might be, often help giving personality to the characters, of which you also have 10 marriage candidates. And yes, you DO have the homosexual options. Although, to my (hetero male) taste, there is maybe only one or two male candidates out of the five possible ones, that are appealing at all. As for the women, the ones I would love are not relationship options... here's looking at you, Robin.

One word of warning, though (as I said, minor spoilers): It is possible to lose animals to wolves or something. As there is no option to make manual saves, this was a gamebreaker for one of my friends who could not find the heart afterwards to go on anymore, and instead played other games again.

Music:
The music is great, it really fits the game.

Graphics:
The graphics are held in a style that reminds of console games, but run absolutely smooth. The world has a distinctive yet familiar look, it feels like a 1990s SNES RPG. I mean, just look at the screenshots at the store page.

Recommended: Yes! Even at full price! In fact the game is so good, I even bought another copy at full price to gift it to a friend!

Oh, and did I mention that this masterpiece was made by one guy alone? That's right, ConcernedApe, as he likes to be called, has created the graphics, music, game code and everything else alone! Kudos!

Now stop reading and start playing the game!

EDIT, 7 October 2016: ConcernedApe added several new farm layouts, so now there is even a strategical choice to be made at the beginning of the game, giving you more potential to follow the profession you prefer: Mining, Fishing, Foraging, even fighting. The mulriplayer coop mode supposedly will come in 2017. Also the game is in the next Humble Monthly Bundle, so there is no reason to not get it right now!",TRUE,1964,124,8,5/24/2016 8:08,steam,1

Stardew Valley is amazing.  It is tremendous.  It fills me with glee and delight.  I have built spreadsheets to calculate maximum crop effeciency not because I need to (it's so easy to get in to you guys) but because I enjoy playing the game even when I am not playing the game.

Do you not wish to feel joy?  Because if so, you are depressed, and may need professional help.  I recommend Stardew Valley for your professional help.

7.66E+16,"If you enjoyed games such as Harvest Moon or even Rune Factory, then you will like this game. I adored both of these games when I was growing up and this, in my opinion, feels like the perfect match to go with their themes. Farming, mining, ranching, monster slaying, ""seducing"" villagers with mainly cheap items, and even a bit of secret to it and it can actually make you obsess over it. My boyfriend even thought I was stupid for liking it so much but now he is at about 50 hours or so on his account and is addicted to the monsters and mining, finishing his skills before me. 

Gameplay: Pretty smooth and can vary thanks to a mechanic of luck, giving reason to go mining or even play games at the Saloon for a super difficult game(Bad Luck) or even seemingly easy game(best luck). The fishing is a little bit touch and go at times but is pretty easy compared to the fishing mechanic of Feel The Snow, another game I enjoyed a bit too much.

Soundtrack: Relaxing pretty much all the time, setting you into a relaxed mood. The sounds get eery in the mines, but still can keep you calmer than a horror game. The sounds for rainy days confused me at first but now are obvious clues as to the weather of the day. Overall, pretty great music as it should be for this style of game but better than I expected for the graphics.

Story: Although it is a big chunk of dialogue and farming (almost literally) for the items involved with the Community Center ""Ending,"" there was a lot that I found to be lack luster. It wasn't as long as I thought it would be. The time I spent on this game itself, at current being over 250 hours, wasn't to just get the items for the CC completion and the Joja completion (although that badge didn't come through). The after story takes a short time at the point of where I was, but also adds a tiny bit of extra backstory on a character you encounter.

Mechanics: There are not only easter eggs and exploits in-game, but also kind of cheeky mechanics in this game. It can be somewhat hard to understand first off but with the help of the options menu's disable/enable features, i.e. Zoom, Show Hit Marker, etc., it can turn into a semi-easy game with pretty simple mechanics.

Overall: Although I had some hiccups with the game, I enjoyed and still enjoy all of it. Even the fact of the title screen having too many easter eggs to even spoil as they blur together. Thank you, dev ConcernedApe and publisher/co-dev ChuckleFish for the release of this game. It really brought back some nostalgia.

Now comes the real question, will you, reader, be good or bad? Thank you for reading and taking my review seriously, if you read every aspect, and hopefully you will enjoy it after you buy it.",TRUE,26555,60,9,4/8/2018 6:14,steam,0

7.66E+16,"I wasn't sure about this game at first. A lot of things seemed really off about it, like the fast timer compared to modern HM games, but it actually ended up being able to rival even the new HM games and anyone who lacks a nintendo console can just pick this game up and basically get the best of the experiences offered by harvest moon. Animal Crossing fans will also find enjoyment in decorating your house and filling up the museum, and Rune Factory fans will enjoy the mines and subsequent risk-to-reward gameplay they provide. In addition to all this, you do NOT have to make friends with your shitty neighbors just to get tools anymore which is probably the best feature of this game. You can basically be a hermit, never get married, and never talk to anyone and you will not miss out. You can even complete one of the two main stories (you can choose which one to complete) without any bullshit socializing like the HM games force on you. But, if you did want to get married, you can even have the option of marrying the same sex which no HM game to date has offered.

The one complaint I have so far is the way the game saves. Saving in games today should be a convenient and accessible feature, this isn't the 80s when batteries were some expensive commodity and games are a lot more involved than they used to be, but this game has a very rigid way of only saving your game between days and you basically have to go through an entire day before you can save again. When you're used to HM games both offering you a diary in your house to save mid-day or even getting the option to skip saving (comes in handy when trying to pray to RNGesus for rainy weather), this can be pretty jarring and I do not understand why the game is like this. All I can figure is the dev prioritized stopping people from cheating over offering better convenience and assurance to the majority of people wh don't, and that was a poor choice. This isn't a PVP game, that is the only time where making design choices solely to prevent people from cheating, even at the expense of legitimate play, is valid, and this being a single-player game basically begs the question ""Who cares?"" when someone wants to cheese it. It isn't like the AI has feelings.",TRUE,12469,155,11,10/30/2016 23:34,steam,2
7.66E+16,"I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HARVEST MOON IS!

Too many reviews say ""this is like Harvest Moon"", ""oh it's so cute like Harvest Moon"" and ""it's a wondeful remake of Harvest Moon"". That's not very helpful. I never played Harvest Moon. I never heard of Harvest Moon (unti this game came along). I was playing computer games when it came out but the SNES was never my cup 'o tea. If you're like me, this is the review for you.

Without knowing what Harvest Moon is, I'm coming into Stardew Valley with a fresh set of eyes. And what these eyes have beheld is pretty magical. The one word I'd use to describe Stardew Valley is enchanting. The game play revolves around building up your farm, fighting / mining in the mines, fishing and bribing the townspeople to like you. It frankly doesn't sound like much but it's much more than the sum of its parts. 

First of all, the farming is deep and entertaining. There are many crops to sow, groves to plant, animals, sap and a host of artisan-type improvements to your basic ingredients. There's simply so much to do here it's tough to see it all. And if you're creative, you can construct some beautiful farms so they are visually pleasing along with productive. It's not easy though - you need to slowly clear your farm, build up your money for seeds and you'll need raw ingredients from elsewhere (mainly mining) to truly become productive and self-sustaining.

Other areas are simple but rewarding. Mining doesn't sound like fun, but each level of the mines brings new challenges and rewards. Fishing can be challenging and even frustrating but as your character levels that skill you'll find you're able to haul in even the most challenging catches. It doesn't seem like the Valley is very large but as you complete challenges in the Community Center new areas will open up, each with it's own unique style and bonuses. You'll forage through the landscape and acquire more resources that way.

The townspeople deserve their own mention. They seem like they're the standard tropes - the jock, the vain girl, etc. - but as you get to know them you'll find they're unique characters and somewhat memorable. The villagers have their own schedules and you'll have to work around those schedules to get what you want. 

As for downsides, probably the most annoying thing is this ""bribe people to be my friends"" aspect. I'm not a fan of the limitations and I'm not a fan of the message that sends. But that's a minor problem with what is just a great, fun, relaxing and entertaining game. I'd recommend this game for people from 8 to 80 (I'm on the older side of that scale). It's simply a wonderful product.",TRUE,28089,185,22,3/19/2016 15:02,steam,1

[h1]Real Review[/h1]

This game is fantastic and incredibly enjoyable. Somehow I have been able to amass 15 hours in the game already... after 2 days... during a school week... And there seems to be tons left to explore and unlock.

From mining, to fishing, to farming, and just exploring and having fun--I always feel like I have something to do, and with the wide variety of things to do, even if I get bored of one activity the other activity is so different that it becomes completely enjoyable again. 

The gameplay is deep. You feel accomplished when you plant and water crops for the first time. You feel excited when you finally get to harvest the crops you've watered every day. Pulling up a big fish is equally satisfying and getting to the next level in the mines is fantastic.

Talking to NPCs isn't particularly exciting as there arent gobs of dialogue, but there's still a pleasant amount to keep me wanting to talk. Getting an NPC to like you makes me feel happy though. There could be a bit of polishing in this way, I've noticed a couple of spelling errors in the dialogue and sometimes wish I could know more about a character, but I'm still pleased with what there is.

I've never played Harvest Moon or Rune Factory, which I've heard is what this game was inspired from, so I can't say how similar it is to either, but since this is my first time playing a game like this, it has been awesome not knowing what to expect. But if you've played either game before and liked them I would assume this would be a great updated version for you.

Also, this game was [u]never in early access[/u] and was made by [b]one developer[/b], which is such a pleasant change from what has been.

[*]Simple, diverse, satisfyingly enjoyable gameplay that is hard not to love even after hours
[*]Unique, lively characters and a beautiful world to explore
[*]Interesting developments in the story and characters that helps fill in the occasional slow parts of the game.

[*]Beautiful graphics for a pixel game
[*]Well suiting music and sound effects that fit well into the mood of the game
[*]Great map that might seem small at first but has a lot more depth to it than first thought

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*]NPC dialogue could be better in my opinion
[*]A few very minor bugs that don't affect much but should still be brought up
[*]*spoiler maybe* You have to replant after each season, causing you to lose any currently planted crops (excluding a couple crops, like corn). It would be nice to know this ahead of time (or at least make it clearer) as it was quite frusturating for me to wake up to all my cauliflower that would have been ready in a few days now wilted... I know this may be obvious to HM players but to players new to the genre like myself, it would be nice if this was mentioned. EDIT: Players now receive a letter two weeks before end of spring stating that this happens. Thank you, dev!
[*]The map showing the location of your character needs improvement, as it is now it just gives you a general idea of where you are, which isn't that bad, but I would prefer if it showed the exact location.
[*]Night lighting could be improved.

Stardew Valley is an amazing game, and going to go on my list as one of my favorites. Its intuitive, unique gameplay is fresh to see.

Another thing I liked about the game is you can fit yourself into the town, you can chat and gain relationship points every day and end up settling down and having kids! Everybody has there own story with this game you can choose from many characters to marry or become friends with you can explore the mysteries of the town hall and the mines, or you can have a peaceful life planning out your farm's layout upgrading your house and buying animals to take care of. Also, the game is a lot like Harvest moon, but at the same time not. I would play this game over harvest moon any day! But it still has the shipping box the foraging mechanic and relationship bar! Another thing I liked is the customization! you can pick from 100+ shirts hair accessories and more you can choose your preference of dogs or cats (If you play the game you know why they do that ;)) And More!

7.66E+16,"To start off, I was initially hesitant to purchase this game because of my dislike for it's publisher Chucklefish. Also, I am not a big fan of farming simulation games, despite enjoying Harvest Moon and other city/empire building sims and 4X games. Most farming sims seem to reach a point of feeling like another job if you wanted to truly succeed, needing to follow a maximized layout for efficiency.
That being said, Stardew Valley truly captured my heart for several reasons. It starts very much like Harvest Moon in that you sort of inherit a farmhouse and some land and you have access to a neighboring town with it's citizens to interact with. You do your farming duties as expected and try to make money to build structures common for a farm, upgrade tools, and interact with the surrounding environment and it's inhabitants within a seemingly short day/night cycle.
What sets it apart from my expectations was how balanced the overall experience feels. There are tasks you will always want to complete, short and long-term goals to strive for, variety of activities to persue each day with little pressure to complete them aside from that which the player puts on themselves. There are seasonal and weather-specific items and events to find/catch/interact with, but they aren't vital unless you want them to be.
The sprites, color palete, music, ambience and overall charm of the game are just right. You can spend most of your time just farming, and going that maximized layout route for highest efficiency if you wanted, though it isn't important. You can spend more time fishing, which is a fairly enjoyable mini-game if you can get the hang of it. You can forage and explore a ""dungeon-style"" mining areas with an acceptable combat system. You can get married to any townsperson with the (single) status, male or female, and have a family.
When a game like this puts multiple suitors to choose from to form a more serious relationship, it needs to give each a variety of personalities and quirks. There are stereotypes, but they have a deeper backstory and feel more relatable to a player of any age and not so generalized to make them seem like cookie cut-outs with expected reactions and desires. There are adult themes, but presented in a way that is acceptable and understandable to anyone.

Overall, it's a very solid game that is more than just a farming/family simulator, has excellent music, great time spent for enjoyment-per-dollar, plenty of goals to persue and achieve without seeming over-burdened or underwhelmed. Just enough feeling and charms without the need for feels.

7.66E+16,"Stardew Valley is an absolute treasure of a game that I've had the delight of experiencing on various consoles. This farming RPG has not just won me over; it's become a time-devouring vortex of joy, gifting me countless hours of pure gaming bliss.

Let's talk visuals firstcharming and nostalgically crafted, reminiscent of the golden age of 16-bit graphics. The pixel art's attention to detail is nothing short of breathtaking, and the lively colors practically breathe life into the Stardew Valley universe.

Now, let's dive into the gameplaya captivating journey where you inherit a dilapidated farm and set out on a quest to resurrect it from its sad state. The ability to tailor your farm, sow crops, tend to animals, and weave intricate relationships with the townsfolk is strangely gratifying.

What sets Stardew Valley miles apart from run-of-the-mill farming simulations is its profound depth and diverse range. It's a virtual playground, offering a myriad of activities, whether you're digging for precious resources in the mines or peacefully casting a line into serene lakes. With every season, new challenges and opportunities arise, ensuring the gameplay is a constant dance of freshness.

And then, the soundtracka symphony of perfection. The tranquil melodies seamlessly meld with the game's calming atmosphere, turning routine tasks like tending to crops into a euphoric experience.

In summary, Stardew Valley isn't just a run-of-the-mill farming RPG; it's a sensational masterpiece that has ensnared me across different gaming platforms. With its enchanting visuals, addictive gameplay, and a smorgasbord of activities, it's a non-negotiable play for genre enthusiasts.

Stardew Valley is a farming and social simulator developed by ConcernedApe. In Stardew, you decide to quit your boring job in the city to move out to a farm you recently inherited from you grandfather, just outside Pelican Town. The farm has been overrun by nature after it being left empty and unloved for many years, your job is to turn it around and start making money out of it. Youre not alone in Pelican Town and youll meet many of the townspeople in the first few days, Pelican Town rarely sees new people moving in so its a big deal when you turn up.

Ive never played any of the games Stardew is compared to, Harvest Moon and the like, and so I took a bit of a gamble when I bought this game. Thankfully I was not disappointed and after playing twenty-five hours in just four days with no sign of stopping anytime soon I couldnt be happier with this game. The game does throw you in at the deep end though so the official wiki is probably going to be your new best friend: http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki

The visuals of the game are similar to Terraria and Starbound but thats where the similarities stop. Anyway, its a great looking game if youre a fan of pixel graphics but even if youre not, you shouldnt write the game off. Everything in the game is well designed and fits in nicely with the style, its also a very colourful game making all the nicer to look at. 

So, as youd imagine, the main gameplay comes from farming. Each of the four seasons (which consist of twenty-eight days each) see a wide variety of different crops and flowers available for you to grow and youll be planting most of your crop at the beginning of the season. Some crops, like parsnips or melons, can only be harvested once before youll need to plant them with new seeds while others, such as corn and cranberries, will continue to produce fruit/vegetables for the rest of the season. Once the season ends, crops specific to that season will die and youll have to clear them away before planting new crops. You will want to plant a variety of crops, mainly for the Community Center bundles (more on that later) but its worth remembering that the more expensive the seeds are, the more valuable the end product will be. There are also fertilizers you can use before planting your crops which will increase the chance of high quality crops (you have basic, silver star (more valuable) and gold star crops (considerably more valuable)) as well as fertilizer that increases growth speed. It doesnt end with planting them though, youll need to look after your crops by watering them each day (unless its raining in which case you dont need to) as well as building scarecrows to keep crows away. You can also harvest or make artisan goods, such as honey or maple syrup which is done through special machines that youll need to unlock and then build.

Unlocks come with levelling up your five skills. Every time you increase a skill (skills are increased by simply using the skill so, for example, your fishing skill is increased by fishing) youll unlock new machines to build as well as increase your proficiency in that skill. Once you hit level five and level ten, instead of unlocking something to build, you choose a profession which will boost a certain area of that skill such as 10% faster crop growth for farming or +1 ore per vein for mining.

Speaking of mining, there are other things to do in Stardew. Mining, fishing and foraging are the main alternatives to farming but theres also social things to do as well as restoring the Community Center. The first three are pretty self-explanatory but Ill briefly talk about fishing. Fishing is the main part of the game argued about in the forums, personally I really like the fishing mini-game but many dont. It consists of trying to keep a green bar behind a moving fish icon and for larger fish it can be quite challenging. However, as you increase your fishing skill and you yourself get more used to the mini-game it does become quite fun and a little less challenging, its also a great way to earn extra money when your farming chores are complete. The social side of things mainly consists of doing little quests for other characters, such as catching a certain fish for Gus (the Saloon owner) to use in a new recipe, but you can also give gifts to other characters to make you like them more. Giving enough gifts to one of the ten bachelors/bachelorettes in the game to get to ten hearts will let you propose to and then marry them, opening you up to the possibility of having kids in the game. The last thing here is the Community Center. The Community Center has long since fallen in to disrepair and once the Mayor unlocks the door for you youll be able to start building it back up by completing bundles of items. Each room has several different bundles for you to complete, completing each bundle will unlock a small reward and completing all the bundles for a given room unlocks a big reward, such as fixing mine carts which can be used for fast travel from three locations. The bundles are mainly for four items though some only require two and other require five. 

The last big thing to touch on is house upgrades and livestock. There are two house upgrades that you can buy which will make your house bigger as well as unlock something new to do, the first upgrade is a kitchen which means you can cook food and the second upgrade adds child beds to your room which youll need if you want kids. To purchase these youll need a fair amount of gold as well as a specific amount of resources which the carpenter will ask for. You can also pay the carpenter to build you what youll need for keeping livestock, ranging from chickens in a coop to cows in a barn. Keeping livestock seems to be a lot more work for a lot less gain than farming crops but you can still get goods from the during winter while you cant grow anything during winter (unless youve repaired the greenhouse through the Community Center). It is also possible to sells the livestock for a profit if you get them up to five hearts but I havent figured out how to do that yet.

Finally, the save system. The game automatically saves when you go to bed at the end of each day and theres no way to manually save. This is another thing a lot of people have complained about, it also happens to be what makes the game so damn addictive. I often find myself doing a couple of things in the morning of a day before I turn the game off before realising that Ill have to finish the day to save my progress. Since the first thing youll do each morning is chores youll find yourself, like I have several times, playing the rest of the day just so you dont lose that progress. It can be frustrating if you need to go and dont have time to finish off a day but its a clever way to keep players playing the game.

[h1]Verdict [/h1]

Stardew Valley offers players an incredibly relaxing and enjoyable experience through its farming simulator style gameplay, though there is more to it than that. Whether youre a fan of similar games or you just want to try something new, I cannot recommend Stardew Valley enough!
